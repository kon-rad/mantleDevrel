While we batch transactions off-chain like other optimistic rollups, our separation of execution, consensus, and data availability layers gives us some interesting advantages.\n\nYou can actually customize your transaction confirmation requirements based on your needs. If you need near real-time confirmations, you can opt for minimal security settings, while critical transactions can wait for full Ethereum finality. This flexibility is possible because we inherit Ethereum's security while allowing for modular optimization.\n\nWould you like me to explain more about how you might optimize the finality settings for your specific use case?"
