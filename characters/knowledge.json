Being EVM-compatible means all the contracts and tools that work on Ethereum also work on Mantle Network with minimal modifications. Users can experiment with exciting web3 apps, and developers can deploy smart contracts in an efficient, low-fee environment. \\nAt its core, Mantle Network has been built with a modular architecture that combines an optimistic rollup protocol with an innovative data availability solution. This allows Mantle Network to inherit security from Ethereum AND offer cheaper and more accessible data availability. \\nIf you find any of these terms unfamiliar, we encourage you to visit Optimistic Rollups and the pages that follow where we go over blockchain, rollups, and Mantle's key innovations in a more approachable way. \\nOn the other hand, if these terms make you excited for the future of blockchain scaling we encourage you to keep reading! \\nMantle Network vs. Non-Rollup Chains\\nEthereum rollups, including Mantle Network, leverage the Ethereum validator set and consensus protocol, which is widely regarded as more secure compared to other layer-1 (L1) validator sets. This grants Mantle Network several advantages, such as:\\nCanonical bridging without relying on third-party bridges\\nCensorship resistance\\nFund recovery options even in the event of critical issues on layer-2 (L2)\\nSecured by Ethereum\\nMantle Network is an L2 scalability solution built on top of Ethereum. The validator nodes collect transactions from users and commit them to Ethereum in the form of a \\\"compressed block\\\". This compression saves users expensive gas fees and increases the total possible throughput for transactions. \\nBy building on top of Ethereum, Mantle Network inherits desirable features like-\\nSecured by Ethereum: L2 state transitions are verified by Ethereum validators, going through the same consensus and settlement process as L1 transactions.\\nCommon developer infrastructure: Smart contract development frameworks like Truffle, Hardhat, Foundry, Remix, etc., languages like Solidity, Vyper, Yul, etc., and libraries like Web3.js and ethers.js, etc. can all be used on Mantle.\\nAt the same time, Mantle Network offers a superior user experience with multiple other benefits as compared to L1, such as-\\nSignificantly lower gas fees: Users enjoy over 80% reduction in gas fees which are achieved through data compression and modular data availability.\\nReduced latency and improved throughput: Users can customize transaction confirmation requirements, with the lowest security setting providing near real-time confirmation latencies (~10 milliseconds versus Ethereum's ~12 seconds). Additionally, Mantle Network achieves a transaction throughput some 20 times greater than Ethereum (500 TPS versus Ethereum's ~25 TPS)\\nModular Architecture\\nMantle Network takes a modular approach with chain design. While monolithic chains perform transaction execution, consensus, settlement, and storage at the same network layer, these processes are handled by separate modules on Mantle Network. In its initial Mainnet version, Mantle Network functions as a Smart Contract Rollup with modular data availability. Hence,\\nMantle's execution layer provides an EVM-compatible environment for transaction execution where the sequencer produces blocks on L2 and sends state root data to L1\\nConsensus and settlement take place on L1 Ethereum\\nData availability services are provided to network actors through Mantle DA powered by EigenDA technology that stores callback data that would be published to L1 in traditional rollups\\nSequencer Properties\\nThe centralized sequencer on Mantle Network produces L2 blocks by including transactions in them in the order they are received by the nodes. It also publishes updated state roots to L1.\\nWe include can additional sequencer module referred to as Threshold Signature Scheme(TSS). This module consists of a set of whitelisted node operators who sign blocks and contribute to multi-party signatures that help improve the correctness of off-chain transaction execution results. In the event that an N of M threshold is not met, the sequencer may re-sequence a batch of L2 blocks, or transition to a backup sequencer.\\nThe transition to a backup sequencer is controlled by the core DevOps team, with measures in place to minimize downtime.\\nFraud Proofs\\nOptimistic Rollups execute transactions that result in state transitions, and updated state data are published to L1 Ethereum assuming their validity and without providing any direct proofs for the same. Mantle Network sends updated state data to a State Commitment Chain (SCC) contract on L1, where network actors can challenge its validity within a challenge period (currently set to 7 days). If the state data goes unchallenged, it is considered valid and final and withdrawal requests that rely on this state data can be processed by other smart contracts.\\nIf a commitment gets challenged, a verifier interacts with the challenger to narrow down the invalidity to a single state transition, at which point its validity is established by executing it. In case of a successful challenge, the state transition is discarded and the contract accepts the valid version of the updated state submitted by the challenger.\\nTo learn more about the advantages of this mechanism, check out the Fraud Proofs page talking about it in detail.\\nData Availability\\nData availability (of L2 batch data) is a critical aspect of Ethereum rollups, such that L1 validators can verify the L2 state. DA is generally the most expensive component of rollups, as it requires Ethereum L1 block space. Common industry approaches to data availability include:\\nOn-Chain L1: All data that is needed for proof construction is available on L1.\\nCentralized DA Committees: Data for proof construction is not available on L1. There exists a committee tasked with supplying the data. This approach presents significant cost savings to the rollup, at the risk that data becomes unavailable.\\nModular Data Availability**: Standalone DA modules, like Mantle DA powered by EigenLayer's EigenDA technology.

Being EVM-compatible means all the contracts and tools that work on Ethereum also work on Mantle Network with minimal modifications. Users can experiment with exciting web3 apps, and developers can deploy smart contracts in an efficient, low-fee environment.\\n\\nAt its core, Mantle Network has been built with a modular architecture that combines an optimistic rollup protocol with an innovative data availability solution. This allows Mantle Network to inherit security from Ethereum AND offer cheaper and more accessible data availability.\\n\\nIf you find any of these terms unfamiliar, we encourage you to visit [Optimistic Rollups](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/concepts/optimistic-rollups) and the pages that follow where we go over blockchain, rollups, and Mantle's key innovations in a more approachable way.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if these terms make you excited for the future of blockchain scaling we encourage you to keep reading!\\n\\n## \\n\\nMantle Network vs. Non-Rollup Chains\\n\\nEthereum rollups, including Mantle Network, leverage the Ethereum validator set and consensus protocol, which is widely regarded as more secure compared to other layer-1 (L1) validator sets. This grants Mantle Network several advantages, such as:\\n\\n*   Canonical bridging without relying on third-party bridges\\n    \\n*   Censorship resistance\\n    \\n*   Fund recovery options even in the event of critical issues on layer-2 (L2)\\n    \\n\\n## \\n\\nSecured by Ethereum\\n\\nMantle Network is an L2 scalability solution built on top of Ethereum. The validator nodes collect transactions from users and commit them to Ethereum in the form of a \\\"compressed block\\\". This compression saves users expensive gas fees and increases the total possible throughput for transactions.\\n\\nBy building on top of Ethereum, Mantle Network inherits desirable features like-\\n\\n*   **Secured by Ethereum:** L2 state transitions are verified by Ethereum validators, going through the same consensus and settlement process as L1 transactions.\\n    \\n*   **Common developer infrastructure:** Smart contract development frameworks like Truffle, Hardhat, Foundry, Remix, etc., languages like Solidity, Vyper, Yul, etc., and libraries like Web3.js and ethers.js, etc. can all be used on Mantle.\\n    \\n\\nAt the same time, Mantle Network offers a superior user experience with multiple other benefits as compared to L1, such as-\\n\\n*   **Significantly lower gas fees:** Users enjoy over 80% reduction in gas fees which are achieved through data compression and modular data availability.\\n    \\n*   **Reduced latency and improved throughput:** Users can customize transaction confirmation requirements, with the lowest security setting providing near real-time confirmation latencies (~10 milliseconds versus Ethereum's ~12 seconds). Additionally, Mantle Network achieves a transaction throughput some 20 times greater than Ethereum (500 TPS versus Ethereum's ~25 TPS)\\n    \\n\\n## \\n\\nModular Architecture\\n\\nMantle Network takes a modular approach with chain design. While monolithic chains perform transaction execution, consensus, settlement, and storage at the same network layer, these processes are handled by separate modules on Mantle Network. In its initial Mainnet version, Mantle Network functions as a Smart Contract Rollup with modular data availability. Hence,\\n\\n*   Mantle's execution layer provides an EVM-compatible environment for transaction execution where the sequencer produces blocks on L2 and sends state root data to L1\\n    \\n*   Consensus and settlement take place on L1 Ethereum\\n    \\n*   Data availability services are provided to network actors through Mantle DA powered by [EigenDA](https://eigenlayer.xyz/) technology that stores callback data that would be published to L1 in traditional rollups\\n    \\n\\n## \\n\\nSequencer Properties\\n\\nThe centralized sequencer on Mantle Network produces L2 blocks by including transactions in them in the order they are received by the nodes. It also publishes updated state roots to L1.\\n\\nWe include can additional sequencer module referred to as [Threshold Signature Scheme](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/concepts/threshold-signature-scheme)(TSS). This module consists of a set of whitelisted node operators who sign blocks and contribute to multi-party signatures that help improve the correctness of off-chain transaction execution results. In the event that an _N of M_ threshold is not met, the sequencer may re-sequence a batch of L2 blocks, or transition to a backup sequencer.\\n\\nThe transition to a backup sequencer is controlled by the core DevOps team, with measures in place to minimize downtime.\\n\\n## \\n\\nFraud Proofs\\n\\nOptimistic Rollups execute transactions that result in state transitions, and updated state data are published to L1 Ethereum assuming their validity and without providing any direct proofs for the same. Mantle Network sends updated state data to a State Commitment Chain (SCC) contract on L1, where network actors can challenge its validity within a challenge period (currently set to 7 days). If the state data goes unchallenged, it is considered valid and final and withdrawal requests that rely on this state data can be processed by other smart contracts.\\n\\nIf a commitment gets challenged, a verifier interacts with the challenger to narrow down the invalidity to a single state transition, at which point its validity is established by executing it. In case of a successful challenge, the state transition is discarded and the contract accepts the valid version of the updated state submitted by the challenger.\\n\\nTo learn more about the advantages of this mechanism, check out the [Fraud Proofs](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/concepts/fraud-proofs) page talking about it in detail.\\n\\n## \\n\\nData Availability\\n\\nData availability (of L2 batch data) is a critical aspect of Ethereum rollups, such that L1 validators can verify the L2 state. DA is generally the most expensive component of rollups, as it requires Ethereum L1 block space. Common industry approaches to data availability include:\\n\\n*   **On-Chain L1:** All data that is needed for proof construction is available on L1.\\n    \\n*   **Centralized DA Committees:** Data for proof construction is not available on L1. There exists a committee tasked with supplying the data. This approach presents significant cost savings to the rollup, at the risk that data becomes unavailable.\\n    \\n*   **Modular Data Availability\\\\*\\\\*:** Standalone DA modules, like Mantle DA powered by [EigenLayer's](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/) EigenDA technology. Data availability is enabled via DA economic game theory involving rewards and stake slashing. Based on internal evaluations, this translates to a 30-70% cost savings compared to on-chain L1.\\n    \\n\\n_\\\\*\\\\* denotes approach of the initial Mantle Network Mainnet version_\\n\\nCheck out the page on [Data Availability](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/concepts/data-availability) to learn more about how modular Data Availability is implemented on Mantle Network.\\n\\n## \\n\\nWhere do I get started?\\n\\nMantle Network's L2 rollup infrastructure is being developed to meet the needs of the growing [**$MNT** ecosystem](https://mantle.xyz/).\\n\\nGet in touch with our growth team [**here**](https://airtable.com/shr9ATBlHZXCKDbPV) for support.\\n\\nYou can find essential info on how to link your wallet to Mantle Network, acquiring testnet tokens, dev tutorials, and more in the [How-to Guides](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/how-to-guides) section.

It abstracts away complexities, making it easier to perform operations like depositing and withdrawing assets.\\nfs: The Node.js fs module for file system operations. It may be used later in the code for reading or writing files, although it's not explicitly used in the provided snippet.\\nNetwork Configuration and Wallet Setup​\\nNext, the code defines some configuration parameters. We fetch the specified network and wallet configurations from the .env file.\\nconst l1bridge = process.env.L1_BRIDGE; const l2bridge = process.env.L2_BRIDGE; const key = process.env.PRIV_KEY;\\nl1bridge and l2bridge: Environment variables representing the addresses of the layer 1 (L1) and layer 2 (L2) bridges.\\nkey: The private key retrieved from the environment variables.\\nWe need to deploy the ERC-20 token by ourselves, so we need to create a factory contract at first.\\nconst L1TestERC20 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('L1TestERC20.json')); const L2StandardERC20 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('L2StandardERC20.json')); const factory__L1_ERC20 = new ethers.ContractFactory( L1TestERC20.abi, L1TestERC20.bytecode, ); const factory__L2_ERC20 = new ethers.ContractFactory( L2StandardERC20.abi, L2StandardERC20.bytecode, );\\nThe configuration parameters required for transfers.\\n// Global variable because we need them almost everywhere let crossChainMessenger; let l1ERC20, l2ERC20; let ourAddr;\\nThen create wallet objects by passing the private key and RPC addresses as parameters for L1 and L2.\\nconst l1RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.L1_RPC); const l2RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.L2_RPC); const l1Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(key, l1RpcProvider); const l2Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(key, l2RpcProvider);\\nSetup CrossChainMessenger Object​\\nThe CrossChainMessenger object calls the cross chain messenger contracts on L1 and L2 to transfer assets. Here we instantiate the object with chain IDs, wallet objects, and contract objects.\\nourAddr = l1Wallet.address; crossChainMessenger = new mantleSDK.CrossChainMessenger({ l1ChainId: process.env.L1_CHAINID, l2ChainId: process.env.L2_CHAINID, l1SignerOrProvider: l1Wallet, l2SignerOrProvider: l2Wallet, bedrock: true, });\\nDeploy the ERC-20 token on L1.\\nconsole.log('#################### Deploy ERC20 ####################'); console.log('Deploying L1 ERC20...'); const L1_ERC20 = await factory__L1_ERC20 .connect(l1Wallet) .deploy('L1 TEST TOKEN', 'LTT'); await L1_ERC20.deployTransaction.wait(); console.log('L1 ERC20 Contract ExampleToken Address: ', L1_ERC20.address);\\nMint the ERC-20 token on L1.\\nlet amount = ethers.utils.parseEther('10'); await L1_ERC20.connect(l1Wallet).mint(amount); balance = ( await L1_ERC20.connect(l1Wallet).balanceOf(l1Wallet.address) ).toString(); console.log('mint to ', l1Wallet.address, balance, ' success');\\nApprove the ERC-20 token on L1.\\nawait L1_ERC20.connect(l1Wallet).approve(l1bridge, amount); let allowance = await L1_ERC20.connect(l1Wallet).allowance( l1Wallet.address, l1bridge, ); console.log('allowance: ', allowance.toString());\\nDeploy the ERC-20 token on L2.\\nconsole.log('Deploying L2 ERC20...'); const L2_ERC20 = await factory__L2_ERC20 .connect(l2Wallet) .deploy(L1_ERC20.address); await L2_ERC20.deployTransaction.wait(); console.log( 'L2 ERC20 Contract BVM_L2DepositedERC20 Address: ', L2_ERC20.address, '\\\\n', ); l1ERC20 = L1_ERC20; l2ERC20 = L2_ERC20;\\nReport the Balances​\\nThe reportBalances function fetches L1 and L2 wallet balances and prints them out. We'll use this method to keep track balance change after deposit and withdraw operations.\\nconst reportERC20Balances = async () => { const l1Balance = await l1ERC20.balanceOf(ourAddr); const l2Balance = await l2ERC20.balanceOf(ourAddr); console.log(`Token on L1:${l1Balance} Token on L2:${l2Balance}`); };\\nDeposit​\\nThe depositERC20 function deposits 1 ERC-20 token to L2 via the Mantle bridge. The asynchronous function prints out the transaction hash and waits for the message to get relayed. Finally, we display the updated LTT balance on L1 and L2.\\nTo show that the deposit actually happened we show before and after balances.\\nconsole.log('#################### Deposit ERC20 ####################'); await reportERC20Balances();\\nTo enable the bridge to transfer ERC-20 tokens, it needs to get an allowance first. The reason to use the SDK here is that it looks up the bridge address for us. While most ERC-20 tokens go through the standard bridge, a few require custom business logic that has to be written into the bridge itself. In those cases, there is a custom bridge contract that needs to get the allowance.\\nconst start = new Date(); // Need the l2 address to know which bridge is responsible const allowanceResponse = await crossChainMessenger.approveERC20( l1ERC20.address, l2ERC20.address, oneToken, );\\nWait until the allowance transaction is processed and then report the time it took and the hash.\\nawait allowanceResponse.wait(); console.log(`Allowance given by tx ${allowanceResponse.hash}`); console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\ncrossChainMessenger.depositERC20() creates and sends the deposit transaction on L1.\\nconst response = await crossChainMessenger.depositERC20( l1ERC20.address, l2ERC20.address, oneToken, );\\nOf course, it takes time for the transaction to actually be processed on L1.\\nconsole.log(`Deposit transaction hash (on L1): ${response.hash}`); await response.wait();\\nAfter the transaction is processed on L1 it needs to be picked up by an off-chain service and relayed to L2. To show that the deposit actually happened we need to wait until the message is relayed. The waitForMessageStatus function does this for us.\\nconsole.log('Waiting for status to change to RELAYED'); console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`); await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus( response.hash, mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED, );\\nOnce the message is relayed the balance change on L2 is practically instantaneous. We can just report the balances and see that the L2 balance rose by 1.\\nawait reportERC20Balances(); console.log(`depositERC20 took ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds\\\\n`);\\nWithdraw​\\nThis function shows how to withdraw ERC-20 from L2 to L1.\\nTo show that the withdrawal actually happened we show before and after balances.\\nconsole.log('#################### Withdraw ERC20 ####################'); const start = new Date(); await reportERC20Balances();\\ncrossChainMessenger.withdrawERC20() creates and sends the withdraw transaction on L2.\\nconst response = await crossChainMessenger.withdrawERC20( l1ERC20.address, l2ERC20.address, oneToken, ); console.log(`Transaction hash (on L2): ${response.hash}`); await response.wait();\\nWe need to wait until the message is ready to prove.\\nconsole.log('Waiting for status to be READY_TO_PROVE'); console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`); await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus( response.hash, mantleSDK.MessageStatus.READY_TO_PROVE, );\\nWait until the state that includes the transaction gets past the challenge period, at which time we can finalize (also known as claim) the transaction. (Make sure your service and network are running well)\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`); await crossChainMessenger.proveMessage(response.hash); console.log('Waiting for status to change to IN_CHALLENGE_PERIOD'); console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`); await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus( response.hash, mantleSDK.MessageStatus.IN_CHALLENGE_PERIOD, ); console.log('In the challenge period, waiting for status READY_FOR_RELAY'); console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`); await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus( response.hash, mantleSDK.MessageStatus.READY_FOR_RELAY, );\\nFinalizing the message also takes a bit of time.\\nconsole.log('Ready for relay, finalizing message now'); console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`); await crossChainMessenger.finalizeMessage(response.hash); console.log('Waiting for status to change to RELAYED'); console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`); await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus( response, mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED, );\\nInvoke deposit and withdraw functions​\\nWe write a main() where we call the functions to perform configuration, deposit, and withdraw operations.\\nconst main = async () => { await setup(); await depositERC20(); await withdrawERC20(); }; main() .then(() => process.exit(0)) .catch((error) => { console.error(error); process.exit(1); });\\nConclusion​\\nYou should now be able to write applications that use our SDK and bridge to transfer ERC-20 assets between L1 and L2.\",\n  \"markdown\": \"# Bridging ERC-20 tokens with the Mantle SDK\\n\\nIf you want to test the functionality of the Mantle SDK, we recommend using the testnet environment instead of the mainnet environment.

The asynchronous function prints out the transaction hash and waits for the message to get relayed. Finally, we display the updated LTT balance on L1 and L2.\\n\\nTo show that the deposit actually happened we show before and after balances.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log('#################### Deposit ERC20 ####################');\\nawait reportERC20Balances();\\n```\\n\\nTo enable the bridge to transfer ERC-20 tokens, it needs to get an allowance first. The reason to use the SDK here is that it looks up the bridge address for us. While most ERC-20 tokens go through the standard bridge, a few require custom business logic that has to be written into the bridge itself. In those cases, there is a custom bridge contract that needs to get the allowance.\\n\\n```\\nconst start = new Date();\\n\\n// Need the l2 address to know which bridge is responsible\\nconst allowanceResponse = await crossChainMessenger.approveERC20(\\n  l1ERC20.address,\\n  l2ERC20.address,\\n  oneToken,\\n);\\n```\\n\\nWait until the allowance transaction is processed and then report the time it took and the hash.\\n\\n```\\nawait allowanceResponse.wait();\\nconsole.log(`Allowance given by tx ${allowanceResponse.hash}`);\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\n```\\n\\n`crossChainMessenger.depositERC20()` creates and sends the deposit transaction on L1.\\n\\n```\\nconst response = await crossChainMessenger.depositERC20(\\n  l1ERC20.address,\\n  l2ERC20.address,\\n  oneToken,\\n);\\n```\\n\\nOf course, it takes time for the transaction to actually be processed on L1.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log(`Deposit transaction hash (on L1): ${response.hash}`);\\nawait response.wait();\\n```\\n\\nAfter the transaction is processed on L1 it needs to be picked up by an off-chain service and relayed to L2. To show that the deposit actually happened we need to wait until the message is relayed. The `waitForMessageStatus` function does this for us.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log('Waiting for status to change to RELAYED');\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\nawait crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(\\n  response.hash,\\n  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED,\\n);\\n```\\n\\nOnce the message is relayed the balance change on L2 is practically instantaneous. We can just report the balances and see that the L2 balance rose by 1.\\n\\n```\\nawait reportERC20Balances();\\nconsole.log(`depositERC20 took ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds\\\\n`);\\n```\\n\\n### \\n\\nWithdraw[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/how-to/bridge-erc20#withdraw)\\n\\nThis function shows how to withdraw ERC-20 from L2 to L1.\\n\\nTo show that the withdrawal actually happened we show before and after balances.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log('#################### Withdraw ERC20 ####################');\\nconst start = new Date();\\nawait reportERC20Balances();\\n```\\n\\n`crossChainMessenger.withdrawERC20()` creates and sends the withdraw transaction on L2.\\n\\n```\\nconst response = await crossChainMessenger.withdrawERC20(\\n  l1ERC20.address,\\n  l2ERC20.address,\\n  oneToken,\\n);\\nconsole.log(`Transaction hash (on L2): ${response.hash}`);\\nawait response.wait();\\n```\\n\\nWe need to wait until the message is ready to prove.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log('Waiting for status to be READY_TO_PROVE');\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\nawait crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(\\n  response.hash,\\n  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.READY_TO_PROVE,\\n);\\n```\\n\\nWait until the state that includes the transaction gets past the challenge period, at which time we can finalize (also known as claim) the transaction.

Clone this repository and enter it.\\n    \\n    ```\\n    git clone https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-tutorial.git\\n    cd mantle-tutorial/cross-dom-bridge-erc721\\n    ```\\n    \\n4.  Install the necessary packages.\\n    \\n\\n## \\n\\nRun the sample code\\n\\nThe sample code is in `index.js`, execute it. This transaction should execute immediately after execution.\\n\\n### \\n\\nNode Environment\\n\\nIf you want to test by using your own nodes, you should configure the missing or changing environment variables in file `.env.local.tmp` then use `yarn local` to execute `index.js`. If you want to have a test in our testnet network you should do the same for `.env.testnet.tmp` and then use `yarn testnet` to execute `index.js`.\\n\\n## \\n\\nHow does it work?\\n\\n```\\n#! /usr/local/bin/node\\n\\nconst ethers = require(\\\"ethers\\\");\\nconst mantleSDK = require(\\\"@mantleio/sdk\\\");\\nconst fs = require(\\\"fs\\\");\\n```\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we initialize the required libraries:\\n\\n*   `ethers`: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides an easy-to-use interface for tasks like creating wallets, sending transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.\\n    \\n*   `mantleSDK`: The Mantleio SDK, which facilitates cross-chain transactions between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchains. It abstracts away complexities, making it easier to perform operations like depositing and withdrawing assets.\\n    \\n*   `fs`: The Node.js `fs` module for file system operations. It may be used later in the code for reading or writing files, although it's not explicitly used in the provided snippet.\\n    \\n\\nNext, the code defines some configuration parameters:\\n\\n```\\nconst key = process.env.PRIV_KEY;\\n```\\n\\n*   `key`: The private key retrieved from the environment variables.\\n    \\n\\n```\\nconst L1TestERC721 =

far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo enable the bridge to transfer ERC-721 tokens, it needs to get an allowance first. The reason to use the SDK here is that it looks up the bridge address for us. While most ERC-721 tokens go through the standard bridge, a few require custom business logic that has to be written into the bridge itself. In those cases, there is a custom bridge contract that needs to get the allowance.\\n\\n```\\nconst response = await crossChainMessenger.depositERC721(\\n  l1ERC721.address,\\n  l2ERC721.address,\\n  tokenId,\\n  {\\n    overrides: {\\n      gasLimit: 400000,\\n    },\\n  }\\n);\\n```\\n\\n[`crossChainMessenger.depositERC721()`](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle/blob/main/packages/sdk/src/cross-chain-messenger.ts#L986) creates and sends the deposit transaction on L1.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log(`Deposit transaction hash (on L1): ${response.hash}`);\\nawait response.wait();\\n```\\n\\nOf course, it takes time for the transaction to actually be processed on L1.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log(\\\"Waiting for status to change to RELAYED\\\");\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\nawait crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(\\n  response.hash,\\n  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED\\n);\\n```\\n\\nAfter the transaction is processed on L1 it needs to be picked up by an off-chain service and relayed to L2. To show that the deposit actually happened we need to wait until the message is relayed. The [`waitForMessageStatus`](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle/blob/4e2e3fe64fc0ba62a473235ec617b4ac2fefd89c/packages/sdk/src/cross-chain-messenger.ts#L508) function does this for us.\\n\\n```\\nawait reportERC721Balances()\\nconsole.log(`depositERC721 took ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds\\\\n`);\\n// depositERC721()\\n```\\n\\nOnce the message is relayed the balance change on L2 is practically instantaneous. We can just report the balances and see that the L2 balance rose by 1.\\n\\n### \\n\\n`withdrawERC721`\\n\\nThis function shows how to withdraw ERC-721 from L2 to L1.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log(\\\"#################### Withdraw ERC721 ####################\\\");\\nconst start = new Date();\\nawait reportERC721Balances();\\n\\nconst response = await crossChainMessenger.withdrawERC721(\\n  l1ERC721.address,\\n  l2ERC721.address,\\n  tokenId\\n);\\nconsole.log(`Transaction hash (on L2): ${response.hash}`);\\nawait response.wait();\\n```\\n\\n[`crossChainMessenger.withdrawERC721()`](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle/blob/main/packages/sdk/src/cross-chain-messenger.ts#L1015) creates and sends the withdraw transaction on L2.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log(\\\"Waiting for status to be READY_TO_PROVE\\\");\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\nawait crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(\\n  response.hash,\\n  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.READY_TO_PROVE\\n);\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\nawait crossChainMessenger.proveMessage(response.hash);\\n\\nconsole.log(\\\"In the challenge period, waiting for status READY_FOR_RELAY\\\");\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\nawait crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(\\n  response.hash,\\n  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.READY_FOR_RELAY\\n);\\n```\\n\\nWait until the state that includes the transaction gets past the challenge period, at which time we can finalize (also known as claim) the transaction.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log(\\\"Ready for relay, finalizing message now\\\");\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\nawait crossChainMessenger.finalizeMessage(response.hash,{\\n    overrides: {\\n      gasLimit: 470000,\\n    },\\n  });\\n\\nconsole.log(\\\"Waiting for status to change to RELAYED\\\");\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\nawait crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(\\n  response,\\n  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED\\n);\\n```\\n\\nFinalizing the message also takes a bit of time.\\n\\n### \\n\\n`main`\\n\\nA `main` to run the setup followed by both operations.\\n\\n```\\nconst main = async () => {\\n  await setup();\\n  await depositERC721();\\n  await withdrawERC721();\\n};\\n\\nmain()\\n  .then(() => process.exit(0))\\n  .catch((error) => {\\n    console.error(error);\\n    process.exit(1);\\n  });\\n```\\n\\n## \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nYou should now be able to write applications that use our SDK and bridge to transfer ERC-721 assets between L1 and L2.\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"browser\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/updated-notices/mantle-network-mainnet-v2-tectonic-upgrade-guide\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/updated-notices/mantle-network-mainnet-v2-tectonic-upgrade-guide\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:31:08.200Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network\",\n    \"depth\": 1,\n    \"httpStatusCode\": 200\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/updated-notices/mantle-network-mainnet-v2-tectonic-upgrade-guide\",\n    \"title\": \"Mantle Network Mainnet v2 Tectonic Upgrade Guide | Network\",\n    \"description\": null,\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"Mantle Network Mainnet v2 Tectonic Upgrade Guide | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/~gitbook/ogimage/Gf9SJflg5yLNf5zZQw5Q\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:31:05 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html;

EIP-1559 is a new transaction method that will be introduced after the Bedrock upgrade of the OP Stack, and will allow transactions on Mantle Network to be executed in a more stable and controlled manner. See here for more information.\\nWhy is the gas fee very high for my transaction?\\nMantle v2 Tectonic introduces EIP-1559 type transactions and also to further reduce gas fees, the FIFO transaction ordering method is chosen to minimize the impact of the priorityfee, so you will need additional settings to optimize your handling fees, for more information check here.\\nWhy is the gas usage so high for my transaction?\\nUnlike most OP Stack-based chains, Mantle chooses to use the MNT native token as the fee for L2 transactions and covers the whole transaction cost (L1 + L2) when calculating the gas usage. Mantle introduces the tokenRatio parameter which helps regulate the price fluctuations between ETH and MNT, when calculating the gas fee, Mantle will multiply with the tokenRatio compared to the other L2s' gasUsed (based on ETH). For example, if tokenRatio is 3000, the gas usage will be calculated as L2GasUsed * 3000 + L1GasUsed * 3000 * scalar.\\nMeanwhile, the gas usage can't reflect the level of gas fees, Mantle still has one of the cheapest fees compared to other L2s.\\nWhy did I get an error when I tried to send a transaction on Mantle Network?\\nThere are various possibilities for transaction failures. Here, we kindly ask you to ensure that your transaction construction has not been affected by any modifications to fees in Mantle v2 Tectonic. For more details, please refer to this page.\\nWhy is the value I get by calling the contract's getL1fee method so much smaller than the actual L1 fee?\\nThis is due to the fact that MNT is used as the native gas fee token in Mantle, and you need to use the tokenRatio parameter to convert between MNT and ETH when calculating the L1 fee, for more information, please check here!\\nDev Tools​\\nCan I use Truffle, Hardhat, and Remix to deploy contracts on Mantle Network?\\nYes. All the EVM-compatible Web3 libraries, IDEs, development frameworks can be used to deploy on and connect to Mantle Network. This includes, but isn't limited to, popular tools such as:\\nYou can check more tutorials here.\\nCan I fetch DA transaction details with an API?\\nCurrently, the only way to see DA transaction history is via the Explorer frontend. Here's the link for Mantle DA data storage: https://mantlescan.xyz/batches\\nDoes the RPC rate limit affect Explorer API usage too?\\nYes. Once the RPC rate limit is reached, access to Explorer API will also be limited.\\nAre there any limits set for batch transaction size?\\nThe maximum batch transaction size is derived from the target gas configuration. Mantle Network is the same as other OP Stack-based chains in this regard.\\nAre there any limits set on return log size for eth_getLogs RPC call?\\nYes, it's best practice to limit the range of blocks you are querying in a single request to prevent issues such as timeout errors or overly large responses, in Mantle Network — 10,000 blocks.\\nDoes Mantle explorer support proxy contracts？\\nIf the contract is detected as a proxy implementation, it can be supported.\\nHow to set the token image on Mantlescan?\\nYou can submit token update via https://mantlescan.xyz/tokenupdate/ or https://mantlescan.xyz/tokenupdate/<address> (append token contract address).\\nHow to add tokens on Mantle's official bridge？\\nYou'll need to make a pull request against the Mantle token list repository. After PR is approved, you need to wait a few minutes before you can check the tokens on the bridge. Check more details here.\\nDoes OpenZeppelin defender support EIP1559 transactions?\\nYes, OpenZeppelin defender support sending EIP1559 transactions now.\\nWhy do I get the error \\\"0x5e not defined\\\" when compiling contracts？\\nThis error occurs because Mantle's op-geth is not up to date, which doesn't support the MCOPY(0x5e) bytecode. To resolve this, specify the compiler version as 0.8.23 or below. And refer this to get more unsupported opcodes.\\nWhy do I get the error \\\"Missing etherscan key for chain 5000/5003\\\" when verifying contracts on Mantlescan by using Foundry?\\nThis error occurs because Foundry had some bugs on this, we encourage developers to verify contracts via Mantlescan explorer rather than using forge, check this for more details.\\nIs the Opcode PUSH0 supported in Mantle?\\nYes, the PUSH0 opcode is supported in Mantle.\\nLast updated 3 months ago\",\n  \"markdown\": \"# FAQs | Network\\n\\n## \\n\\nGeneral[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/faqs#general)\\n\\n*   **Does Mantle Network support EIP-1559?**\\n    \\n    **Mantle Network supports EIP-1559.** EIP-1559 is a new transaction method that will be introduced after the Bedrock upgrade of the OP Stack, and will allow transactions on Mantle Network to be executed in a more stable and controlled manner.

Once the RPC rate limit is reached, access to Explorer API will also be limited.\\n    \\n*   **Are there any limits set for batch transaction size?**\\n    \\n    The maximum batch transaction size is derived from the target gas configuration. Mantle Network is the same as other OP Stack-based chains in this regard.\\n    \\n*   **Are there any limits set on return log size for** `**eth_getLogs**` **RPC call?**\\n    \\n    Yes, it's best practice to limit the range of blocks you are querying in a single request to prevent issues such as timeout errors or overly large responses, in Mantle Network — 10,000 blocks.\\n    \\n*   **Does Mantle explorer support proxy contracts？**\\n    \\n    If the contract is detected as a proxy implementation, it can be supported.\\n    \\n*   **How to set the token image on Mantlescan?**\\n    \\n    You can submit token update via `https://mantlescan.xyz/tokenupdate/` or `https://mantlescan.xyz/tokenupdate/<address>` (append token contract address).\\n    \\n*   **How to add tokens on Mantle's official bridge？**\\n    \\n    You'll need to make a pull request against the Mantle token list repository. After PR is approved, you need to wait a few minutes before you can check the tokens on the bridge. Check more details [here](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-developers/quick-access#adding-a-token-to-the-list).\\n    \\n*   **Does OpenZeppelin defender support EIP1559 transactions?**\\n    \\n    Yes, OpenZeppelin defender support sending EIP1559 transactions now.\\n    \\n*   **Why do I get the error \\\"0x5e not defined\\\" when compiling contracts？**\\n    \\n    This error occurs because Mantle's op-geth is not up to date, which doesn't support the `MCOPY(0x5e)` bytecode. To resolve this, specify the compiler version as **0.8.23** or below. And refer [this](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-developers/difference-between-ethereum-and-mantle#unsupported-opcodes) to get more unsupported opcodes.\\n    \\n*   **Why do I get the error \\\"Missing etherscan key for chain 5000/5003\\\" when verifying contracts on Mantlescan by using Foundry?**\\n    \\n    This error occurs because Foundry had [some bugs](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/7466) on this, we encourage developers to verify contracts via Mantlescan explorer rather than using forge, check [this](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-developers/how-to-guides/how-to-verify-smart-contracts/use-explorer-to-verify-smart-contracts#compiled-using-foundry) for more details.\\n    \\n*   **Is the Opcode** `**PUSH0**` **supported in Mantle?**\\n    \\n    Yes, the `PUSH0` opcode is supported in Mantle.\\n    \\n\\nLast updated 3 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"browser\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/whats-new-in-mantle-v2-tectonic\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/whats-new-in-mantle-v2-tectonic\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:31:12.165Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network\",\n    \"depth\": 1,\n    \"httpStatusCode\": 200\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduction/whats-new-in-mantle-v2-tectonic\",\n    \"title\": \"What's New in Mantle v2 Tectonic | Network\",\n    \"description\": null,\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"What's New in Mantle v2 Tectonic | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/~gitbook/ogimage/zvzCELEP7EG1xZzE1Vjl\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:31:10 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html; charset=utf-8\",\n      \"cf-cache-status\": \"DYNAMIC\",\n      \"cache-control\": \"no-cache\",\n      \"link\": \"<https://static.gitbook.com>; rel=preconnect; crossorigin=\\\"\\\"\",\n      \"strict-transport-security\": \"max-age=31536000\",\n      \"vary\": \"RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, Next-Router-Prefetch, Accept-Encoding\",\n      \"cf-placement\": \"local-DFW\",\n      \"content-security-policy\": \"default-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; script-src 'self' 'nonce-ZDdiNzk3M2UtZTY5MC00YmQ2LTk5MTktZDY1Y2I3MzZmN2Qw' 'strict-dynamic' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://static.gitbook.com https://integrations.gitbook.com https://cdn.iframe.ly; style-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline'; img-src * 'self' blob: data: files.gitbook.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; connect-src * 'self' integrations.gitbook.com app.gitbook.com api.gitbook.com srv.buysellads.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com https://static.gitbook.com; frame-src *; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; form-action 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; frame-ancestors https: ;\",\n      \"nel\": \"{\\\"success_fraction\\\":0, \\\"report_to\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\", \\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"referrer-policy\": \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\",\n      \"report-to\": \"{\\\"endpoints\\\":[{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\\\/report\\\\/v4?s=6rosz9oUnNHeJDVYXdKbn8UXSf9I9QXWuPXW6U0RmBSyQpU%2FBoWxipECozqeIcG6wEfqjhTvgjWpCCwhljVl1iyUGedUm1fuewW8M3Hb5I2Fsk561w5lSHA4EhuMwlYf2JEkVjWMJrpSUqoKWKTz\\\"}], \\\"group\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\", \\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"x-content-type-options\": \"nosniff\",\n      \"x-edge-runtime\": \"1\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache\": \"miss\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache-tag\": \"release-10.9.1072, site:site_GuZBK\",\n      \"x-gitbook-version\": \"3d1eb53\",\n      \"x-http-method\": \"GET\",\n      \"x-matched-path\": \"/middleware/[[...pathname]]\",\n      \"server\": \"cloudflare\",\n      \"cf-ray\": \"91280f5a8eab2ca2-DFW\",\n      \"content-encoding\": \"br\",\n      \"x-firefox-spdy\": \"h2\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"screenshotUrl\": null,\n  \"text\": \"What's New in Mantle v2 Tectonic\\nThe development of Mantle Network Mainnet Alpha v1 (Mantle v1) began in late 2022, utilizing the OVM codebase, and predated the introduction of the OP Stack.

Here is a detailed guide on how to configure your wallet.\\n\\n### \\n\\nCreate a Transaction\\n\\nWhen you are ready to send a transaction using MetaMask, construct the transaction first, at which point we can see that the `Estimated fee` before it is set is a higher value.\\n\\n![](https://docs.mantle.xyz/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs-v2.mantle.xyz%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fmetamask-5-307e0865a654cff6b32d0e0cbdf1f048.png&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=8a026053&sv=2)\\n\\n### \\n\\nPrepare Your Transaction Configuration\\n\\nClick the `Next` button, and then click the red box to enter the setting interface.\\n\\n![](https://docs.mantle.xyz/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs-v2.mantle.xyz%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fmetamask-6-c23111cc33bb16d7b70595aa341f73b7.png&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=6aa7777b&sv=2)\\n\\n### \\n\\nConfigure the Gas Fee\\n\\nSelect the `Advanced` button and we can see that we can set the `Max base fee` and `Priority Fee`, see [here](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/system-information/fee-mechanism/eip-1559-support#application-of-eip-1559-in-mantle-v2-tectonic) for the meaning of these two items. Here we set them to the lowest values, i.e. `Max base fee` is 0.02 gwei and `Priority Fee` is 0. Check the box below \\\"Save these values as my default for the Mantle sepolia network. \\\", and then click the ❌ button in the upper right corner.\\n\\n![](https://docs.mantle.xyz/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs-v2.mantle.xyz%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fmetamask-7-fa653c4a460d25d11d9fca15501c1452.png&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=66d97766&sv=2)\\n\\n### \\n\\nConfirm thr Transaction\\n\\nOnce the settings are complete, when you reconstruct the transaction, you will see that the `Estimated fee` will be very low, click `Confirm` to send the transaction.\\n\\n![](https://docs.mantle.xyz/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs-v2.mantle.xyz%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fmetamask-8-c9fe29570f11a7151d1c723fb1a90919.png&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=d014e8a6&sv=2)\\n\\nWith this setup, you will enjoy extreamely high speed and low cost transaction processing in Mantle v2 Tectonic.\\n\\nLast updated 3 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"browser\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-users/how-to-guides/fetching-test-tokens\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-users/how-to-guides/fetching-test-tokens\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:31:24.864Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network\",\n    \"depth\": 1,\n    \"httpStatusCode\": 200\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-users/how-to-guides/fetching-test-tokens\",\n    \"title\": \"Fetching Test Tokens | Network\",\n    \"description\": null,\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"Fetching Test Tokens | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/~gitbook/ogimage/Ln7Ytu6SOSlGOziKHHA8\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:31:23 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html; charset=utf-8\",\n      \"cf-cache-status\": \"DYNAMIC\",\n      \"cache-control\": \"no-cache\",\n      \"link\": \"<https://static.gitbook.com>; rel=preconnect; crossorigin=\\\"\\\"\",\n      \"strict-transport-security\": \"max-age=31536000\",\n      \"vary\": \"RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, Next-Router-Prefetch, Accept-Encoding\",\n      \"cf-placement\": \"local-DFW\",\n      \"content-security-policy\": \"default-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; script-src 'self' 'nonce-NDI0ZDk1YmItMWY5MS00MmZmLTg4NWQtNTFlMWQ4NzM2MWNm' 'strict-dynamic' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://static.gitbook.com https://integrations.gitbook.com https://cdn.iframe.ly; style-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline'; img-src * 'self' blob: data: files.gitbook.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; connect-src * 'self' integrations.gitbook.com app.gitbook.com api.gitbook.com srv.buysellads.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com https://static.gitbook.com; frame-src *; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; form-action 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; frame-ancestors https: ;\",\n      \"nel\": \"{\\\"success_fraction\\\":0, \\\"report_to\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\", \\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"referrer-policy\": \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\",\n      \"report-to\": \"{\\\"endpoints\\\":[{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\\\/report\\\\/v4?s=dH%2BhvbCbyJlES4RbBvNFbDGcGEl%2F2vp4BZIi5dzom5b9DdEVOqFQGuXFHA8I47N7x%2F9qcdqf8JaQppNi32%2BXU7NkSpwR7HhL62KmLDmkBr9bQRFceBIDgvcI2M1j79dkbUb2xWN0KdOh03PCIdgG\\\"}], \\\"group\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\", \\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"x-content-type-options\": \"nosniff\",\n      \"x-edge-runtime\": \"1\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache\": \"miss\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache-tag\": \"release-10.9.1072, site:site_GuZBK\",\n      \"x-gitbook-version\": \"3d1eb53\",\n      \"x-http-method\": \"GET\",\n      \"x-matched-path\": \"/middleware/[[...pathname]]\",\n      \"server\": \"cloudflare\",\n      \"cf-ray\": \"91280fa82a562ca2-DFW\",\n      \"content-encoding\": \"br\",\n      \"x-firefox-spdy\": \"h2\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"screenshotUrl\": null,\n  \"text\": \"Fetching Test Tokens | Network\\nFaucets​\\nTo begin transacting on Mantle v2 Tectonic Testnet, you must acquire Sepolia $ETH and testnet $MNT and bridge it across.

The L1 rollup fee is a crucial component ensuring the overall system's secure operation and also affects the overall transaction costs.\\nFor a more in-depth understanding, it is highly recommended to read the Mantle research team's study on fees in Rollups: Transaction Fees on Rollups\\nUnderstanding Fees on Mantle v2 Tectonic​\\nIn Mantle v2 Tectonic, the introduction of Mantle's native token design incorporates a tokenRatio parameter to adjust the fee:\\nL2ExecutionFee=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatioL2ExecutionFee=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatio \\nL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalarL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalar\\nL2 Execution Fee in Mantle v2 Tectonic​\\nThe size of the L2 Execution Fee is primarily influenced by two key factors that directly shape the cost of executing transactions on L2.\\nL2ExecutionFee=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatioL2ExecutionFee=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatio\\nLet's delve into these factors:\\nL2 gasUsed - Complexity of Transaction Execution​\\nL2 gasUsed is the amount of gas consumed to execute a transaction on layer 2. This value is directly related to the complexity of the transaction and reflects the amount of work involved in executing the contract, computing, and processing the data. As a result, more complex transactions typically require more gas to complete, directly affecting the size of the L2 execution fee. This factor ensures that the transaction fee is proportional to the actual computational resources used.\\nL2 gasPrice - Depends on the transaction type​\\nL2 gasPrice is the unit price of gas used on L2, which depends on the specific transaction type chosen. L2 gasPrice is calculated differently for different transaction types:\\nFor EIP-1559 transaction types, L2 gasPrice is affected by the GasTipCap parameter, which is a parameter that is issued as a reward to sequencers and can be set to 0 by the user and does not affect the packing of transactions.\\nFor legacy transaction types, GasTipCap takes the default value (0.1 GWEI). In this case, eth_gasPrice is equal to the sum of GasTipCap and BASEFEE. This mechanism ensures the relative stability of the transaction costs, while providing the user with default values and simplifying the setup of the transaction parameters.\\nDue to EVM compatibility, transactions on Mantle Network generally have similar gasUsed to Ethereum. Gas prices fluctuate with time and congestion, but you can always check the current estimated L2 Gas prices on the public Mantle dashboard. Moreover, as gas fees on Mantle Network are denominated in $MNT, transaction costs remain significantly lower than other L2 networks using $ETH as the gas token, even at the same gas price.\\nL1 Rollup Fee in Mantle v2 Tectonic​\\nSince the cost of transaction on L1 is much higher than that of transaction on L2, this is the largest part of the total transaction cost, and calculating the cost of L1 is a complex task due to the volatility of gasPrice in L1.\\nL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalarL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalar\\nLet's delve into these factors:\\nrollupDataGasCalculation​\\nThe major portion of the L1 gas fee is rollupDataGas, which relates to the size of the transaction stored as calldata in L1, and typically accounts for more than 85% of the L1 GasUsed.\\nMantle v2 Tectonic chooses the Op Stack's rollupDataGas calculation, which counts the number of zero bytes and non-zero bytes in the transaction data, with each zero byte costing 4 Gas and each non-zero byte costing 16 Gas, thus:\\nrollupDataGas=count​zero​bytes(tx​data)∗4+count​non​zero​bytes(tx​data)∗16rollupDataGas=count_​zero_​bytes(tx_​data)∗4+count_​non_​zero_​bytes(tx_​data)∗16\\nWith the EigenDA-powered Mantle DA module online with Mantle Mainnet, only state roots and a limited amount of necessary transaction data are sent to L1, while the transaction batch data is posted to the DA network. For dApps with high gas consumption, they can be executed at the same cost as an ordinary transaction (like a transfer), and the L1 fee will not increase with the complexity of L2 transaction execution. As a result, for transactions with high complexity, this can even save up to more than 90% of the cost compared to the original L1 rollup fee.\\nFetchoverheadandscalar​\\noverhead and scalar are currently loaded from configurations, not supporting dynamic changes, you can fetch them from the BVM_GasPriceOracle contract, while L1gasPrice needs to be read from L1 blocks.\\nControl of tokenRatio​\\ntokenRatio is a parameter adjusting fees in Mantle. By obtaining prices for ETH and MNT from multiple price oracles and calculating their exchange rate (eth_price/mnt_price), Mantle v2 Tectonic limits the value of the current tokenRatio to the interval of the previous tokenRatio to prevent sudden and significant fluctuations in gasPrice caused by abrupt changes in the exchange rate.\\nMantle v2 Tectonic introduces a BVM_GasPriceOracle contract in Layer 2 to manage permissions for setting and updating tokenRatio. Users with permission (a multi-signature address managed through HSM) can update tokenRatio through an L2 transaction, dynamically adjusting gas fees.\\nFee Optimization​\\nCompared to Mantle v1, Mantle v2 Tectonic has made improvements and optimizations in fee design, including:\\nEIP-1559 Support: Mantle v2 Tectonic will support various transaction types, including EIP-1559, freeing users from the constraints of old transaction structures. For more details, refer to this. \\nWe highly recommend you to set the baseFee to 0.02 gwei and priorityfee to 0 in your L2 transaction. Refer to this for more details.\\nFee Estimation: The estimateGas API in Mantle v1 only returns the L2 gas cost, the L1 gas estimation needs to be calculated separately, while in Mantle v2 Tectonic it will support returning the total gas of the user's transaction directly. Developers also need to be mindful of the impact this optimization may have on transaction construction.

Users can now enjoy a user experience similar to ETH without the need for MNT to adopt different flow paths, as is the case with ERC-20 assets.\\n\\nThese changes not only positively impact the overall performance and user experience of the Mantle system, but also establish a solid foundation for future expansions and ecosystem development.\\n\\nLast updated 3 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-node-operators/deployment-guides/mainnet-v1.0.0/deploying-a-rollup-verifier-replica-node-from-binary\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-node-operators/deployment-guides/mainnet-v1.0.0/deploying-a-rollup-verifier-replica-node-from-binary\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:32:08.180Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network\",\n    \"depth\": 1\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-node-operators/deployment-guides/mainnet-v1.0.0/deploying-a-rollup-verifier-replica-node-from-binary\",\n    \"title\": \"Deploying a Rollup Verifier/Replica Node From Binary | Network\",\n    \"description\": null,\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"Deploying a Rollup Verifier/Replica Node From Binary | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/~gitbook/ogimage/jE789m5aclaQMPaokPxq\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:32:08 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html; charset=utf-8\",\n      \"transfer-encoding\": \"chunked\",\n      \"connection\": \"keep-alive\",\n      \"cf-cache-status\": \"DYNAMIC\",\n      \"cache-control\": \"no-cache\",\n      \"link\": \"<https://static.gitbook.com>; rel=preconnect; crossorigin=\\\"\\\"\",\n      \"strict-transport-security\": \"max-age=31536000\",\n      \"vary\": \"RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, Next-Router-Prefetch, Accept-Encoding\",\n      \"x-matched-path\": \"/middleware/[[...pathname]]\",\n      \"cf-placement\": \"remote-ORD\",\n      \"content-security-policy\": \"default-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; script-src 'self' 'nonce-NjQ4NmJlYmQtZDg1Yy00MmU2LTg5MDYtMDFlMGU3OGU0NDQ3' 'strict-dynamic' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://static.gitbook.com https://integrations.gitbook.com https://cdn.iframe.ly; style-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline'; img-src * 'self' blob: data: files.gitbook.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; connect-src * 'self' integrations.gitbook.com app.gitbook.com api.gitbook.com srv.buysellads.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com https://static.gitbook.com; frame-src *; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; form-action 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; frame-ancestors https: ;\",\n      \"nel\": \"{\\\"success_fraction\\\":0,\\\"report_to\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"referrer-policy\": \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\",\n      \"report-to\": \"{\\\"endpoints\\\":[{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\\\/report\\\\/v4?s=UhQpQpCr%2Fi1Z6NvHgG3iAfArACjdIxWMZKRuc7xgW2wayThAKxyUTPTQ1lA%2BKCClYxh3MwdzyBFFw7OjBZIGxJFa4prTwrsEwxv30fY26NXWnXkJqsqcngAIyzvNWHy0azF6wt1KpyHUai1AGow2\\\"}],\\\"group\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"x-content-type-options\": \"nosniff\",\n      \"x-edge-runtime\": \"1\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache\": \"miss\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache-tag\": \"release-10.9.1072,site:site_GuZBK\",\n      \"x-gitbook-version\": \"3d1eb53\",\n      \"x-http-method\": \"GET\",\n      \"server\": \"cloudflare\",\n      \"cf-ray\": \"912810c0feeea5f2-IAD\",\n      \"content-encoding\": \"br\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"screenshotUrl\": null,\n  \"text\": \"Deploying a Rollup Verifier/Replica Node From Binary\\nTo build an app on Mantle network, you'll need access to a Mantle node.

You can check it here - currently, the L2 BaseFee is fixed at 20,000,000 wei (0.02 gwei).\\nBASEFEE will no longer burn and will be collected in BaseFeeVault while supporting withdrawal to L1.\\nGasTipCap Adjustment Mechanism:\\nIn each transaction, take the smallest value of GasTip and (GasFeeCap - BaseFee) and multiply it by gasUsed as an award to the validator, have it collected in SequencerFeeVault, and support withdrawal to L1.\\nMantle v2 Tectonic, in an effort to further reduce fees, chose the FIFO method of transaction sequencing to minimize the impact of priorityfee.\\nThrough these adjustments, Mantle v2 Tectonic builds on EIP-1559 to provide a more flexible and efficient transaction fee management mechanism.\\nMantle v2 Tectonic sets a very low BASEFEE, we also recommend that you set the MaxPriorityFeePerGas of your EIP-1559 transactions to 0, so that your transaction fees will be very low! \\nLast updated 2 months ago\",\n  \"markdown\": \"# EIP-1559 Support | Network\\n\\n[EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md) is an upgrade proposal put forth by the Ethereum community, aiming to address network security issues by adjusting the structure of transaction fees.

EIP-1559 allows for the adjustment of block utilization, enabling a longer-term average block size limit.\\n    \\n*   **Enhancing network security**: Additional incentives (`GasTipCap`) help eliminate validators' dependence on block rewards, thereby strengthening network security.\\n    \\n\\n## \\n\\nApplication of EIP-1559 in Mantle v2 Tectonic[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/eip-1559#application-of-eip-1559-in-mantle-v2-tectonic)\\n\\nIn Mantle v2 Tectonic, we have made the following adjustments to `BASEFEE` and `GasTipCap`:\\n\\n*   `**BASEFEE**` **Adjustment Mechanism**:\\n    \\n    *   The `BASEFEE` for Mantle L2 is a system parameter set through the [`SystemConfig`](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/system-information/on-chain-system/contract-introduction#systemconfigproxy) contract on Ethereum L1 and synchronized to Mantle L2. You can check it [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x427Ea0710FA5252057F0D88274f7aeb308386cAf#readProxyContract#F3) - currently, the L2 BaseFee is fixed at 20,000,000 wei (0.02 gwei).\\n        \\n    *   `BASEFEE` will no longer burn and will be collected in [BaseFeeVault](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2/blob/develop/specs/predeploys.md#basefeevault) while supporting withdrawal to L1.\\n        \\n    \\n*   `**GasTipCap**` **Adjustment Mechanism**:\\n    \\n    *   In each transaction, take the smallest value of `GasTip` and `(GasFeeCap - BaseFee)` and multiply it by `gasUsed` as an award to the validator, have it collected in [SequencerFeeVault](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2/blob/develop/specs/predeploys.md#sequencerfeevault), and support withdrawal to L1.\\n        \\n    *   Mantle v2 Tectonic, in an effort to further reduce fees, chose the [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO) method of transaction sequencing to minimize the impact of `priorityfee`.\\n        \\n    \\n\\nThrough these adjustments, Mantle v2 Tectonic builds on EIP-1559 to provide a more flexible and efficient transaction fee management mechanism.\\n\\nMantle v2 Tectonic sets a very low `BASEFEE`, we also recommend that you set the `MaxPriorityFeePerGas` of your EIP-1559 transactions to 0, so that your transaction fees will be very low!\\n\\nLast updated 2 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-node-operators/deployment-guides/testnet-v1.1.0\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-node-operators/deployment-guides/testnet-v1.1.0\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:32:10.003Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network\",\n    \"depth\": 1\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-node-operators/deployment-guides/testnet-v1.1.0\",\n    \"title\": \"Testnet (v1.1.0) | Network\",\n    \"description\": null,\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"Testnet (v1.1.0) | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/~gitbook/ogimage/CL0OTpMQddRXx9aUCrS5\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:32:09 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html;

This design provides the system with an emergency rescue mechanism, enabling it to confront unpredictable threats at any time.\\n\\nThrough these three key aspects of security assurance, Mantle Network has constructed a robust counter-risk model, offering users and developers a trustworthy L2 scaling solution and driving the healthy development of the entire decentralized ecosystem.\\n\\nLast updated 3 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/system-information/fee-mechanism/estimate-fees\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/system-information/fee-mechanism/estimate-fees\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:32:10.303Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network\",\n    \"depth\": 1\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/system-information/fee-mechanism/estimate-fees\",\n    \"title\": \"Estimate Fees | Network\",\n    \"description\": null,\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"Estimate Fees | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/~gitbook/ogimage/XyXnyhkFy8E1WLzg0MHl\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:32:10 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html; charset=utf-8\",\n      \"transfer-encoding\": \"chunked\",\n      \"connection\": \"keep-alive\",\n      \"cf-cache-status\": \"DYNAMIC\",\n      \"cache-control\": \"no-cache\",\n      \"link\": \"<https://static.gitbook.com>; rel=preconnect; crossorigin=\\\"\\\"\",\n      \"strict-transport-security\": \"max-age=31536000\",\n      \"vary\": \"RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, Next-Router-Prefetch, Accept-Encoding\",\n      \"x-matched-path\": \"/middleware/[[...pathname]]\",\n      \"cf-placement\": \"remote-ORD\",\n      \"content-security-policy\": \"default-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; script-src 'self' 'nonce-OTNmMTRmYjgtYmIyNS00MTZjLTg0YjEtNDg4NDQyNDdhYzM1' 'strict-dynamic' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://static.gitbook.com https://integrations.gitbook.com https://cdn.iframe.ly; style-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline'; img-src * 'self' blob: data: files.gitbook.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; connect-src * 'self' integrations.gitbook.com app.gitbook.com api.gitbook.com srv.buysellads.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com https://static.gitbook.com; frame-src *; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; form-action 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; frame-ancestors https: ;\",\n      \"nel\": \"{\\\"success_fraction\\\":0,\\\"report_to\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"referrer-policy\": \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\",\n      \"report-to\": \"{\\\"endpoints\\\":[{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\\\/report\\\\/v4?s=fTcyCqNLrJALo7zyuwJAt8OA3xMtYc%2FaPQnAiLN1V9Ftf2TMD1SvUFtnomzSWJAludvEib5DXQi39HRBSyAGAcJ9sMy0XdqbQEWIVl%2Be43sADbO2WTmzjBD9KhjQBbaVe8Rr8raK9IpkRfNzYuvv\\\"}],\\\"group\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"x-content-type-options\": \"nosniff\",\n      \"x-edge-runtime\": \"1\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache\": \"miss\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache-tag\": \"release-10.9.1072,site:site_GuZBK\",\n      \"x-gitbook-version\": \"3d1eb53\",\n      \"x-http-method\": \"GET\",\n      \"server\": \"cloudflare\",\n      \"cf-ray\": \"912810cb79562d06-IAD\",\n      \"content-encoding\": \"br\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"screenshotUrl\": null,\n  \"text\": \"Estimate Fees | Network\\nEstimate Fees in Mantle v2 Tectonic​\\nConcerning the selection of the gas fee token on layer 2 (L2), Mantle v2 Tectonic departs from the conventional ETH solution adopted by most rollups, and employs MNT instead.

Comment Edit from here\\nIntegrating customizable modules for Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Account Abstraction (AA), Particle facilitates quick onboarding in just 2-clicks via social login options like Google, email, and phone, alongside traditional Web3 login methods.\\nParticle Network is compatible with Mantle Mainnet and Testnet, supporting EOA interactions and native ERC-4337 via implementations like SimpleAccount, Biconomy V2, and Cyber Connect.\\nThis tutorial guides you through the steps for building a demo application on Mantle Sepolia using the Particle Connect SDK — Particle's flagship onboarding SDK. The Particle Connect SDK enables quick 2-click onboarding with social and Web3 login options in a single modal. In this demo, we'll onboard users through a SimpleAccount instance of a smart account via social login and execute a gasless (sponsored) transaction.\\nGetting Started \\nThis tutorial is based on a Next.js app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to demonstrate wallet creation on Mantle using social logins.\\nThe Particle Connect SDK simplifies wallet creation, user authentication, and blockchain interactions, providing a streamlined interface that supports social logins and traditional Web3 wallets.\\nPrerequisites \\nTo integrate Particle Connect into your Mantle application, you'll need just a few dependencies. Particle Connect includes built-in Account Abstraction (AA) support, but in this example, we’ll also install the Particle AA SDK to use EIP-1193 providers like ethers.\\nyarn add @particle-network/connectkit viem@^2 @particle-network/aa ethers\\nConfiguring the Particle Dashboard \\nTo get started with the setup, visit the Particle dashboard to retrieve three essential values for your project.\\nWhen using any Particle Network SDK, you'll need a projectId, clientKey, and appId to authenticate your project and establish a connection between your Particle Auth instance and the Particle dashboard. This setup allows you to customize in-app modals, track users, manage your Paymaster funds, and more.\\nOnce you're in the Particle dashboard, follow these steps:\\nGo to Add New Project to create a new project.\\nChoose a name and domain for your app. You can use a placeholder here if you haven't finalized your deployment domain.\\nCopy your Project ID, Client Key, and App ID.\\nFor security, it's best to store these values in a .env file in this format:\\nNEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID='PROJECT_ID' NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY='CLIENT_KEY' NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID='APP_ID' NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID='WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID'\\nConfiguring Particle Connect \\nFirst, let’s configure and initialize Particle Connect. Create a new file called ConnectKit.tsx in your src directory. In this file, we’ll define the ParticleConnectKit component, which wraps the configured ConnectKitProvider instance and acts as the primary interface for handling configuration.\\n\\\"use client\\\"; import React from \\\"react\\\"; import { ConnectKitProvider, createConfig } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit\\\"; import { authWalletConnectors } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit/auth\\\"; import { evmWalletConnectors } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit/evm\\\"; import { mantleSepoliaTestnet } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit/chains\\\"; import { wallet, EntryPosition } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit/wallet\\\"; import { aa } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit/aa\\\"; const config = createConfig({ projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID!, clientKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY!, appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID!, walletConnectors: [ authWalletConnectors({}), // Social logins // Default Web3 logins evmWalletConnectors({ walletConnectProjectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID, // optional, retrieved from https://cloud.walletconnect.com }), ], plugins: [ wallet({ entryPosition: EntryPosition.BR, // Positions the modal button at the bottom right on login visible: true, // Determines if the wallet modal is displayed }), aa({ name: \\\"SIMPLE\\\", version: \\\"2.0.0\\\", }), ], chains: [mantleSepoliaTestnet], }); export const ParticleConnectkit = ({ children }: React.PropsWithChildren) => { return <ConnectKitProvider config={config}>{children}</ConnectKitProvider>; };\\nThis code configures Particle Connect to enable wallet authentication and blockchain interactions on Mantle Sepolia. It supports social logins and standard Web3 options via WalletConnect and includes Account Abstraction (AA) with a simpleAccount instance, version 2.0.0. The configured ConnectKitProvider component wraps the app’s content, ensuring this setup is accessible throughout the application.\\nIntegrate Particle Connect in Your App \\nAfter configuration, wrap your application with the ParticleConnectKit component to provide access to the Particle Connect SDK across the app. Update the layout.tsx file in the src directory as follows:\\nimport { ParticleConnectkit } from \\\"@/components/Connectkit\\\"; import type { Metadata } from \\\"next\\\"; import { Inter } from \\\"next/font/google\\\"; import \\\"./globals.css\\\"; const inter = Inter({ subsets: [\\\"latin\\\"] }); export const metadata: Metadata = { title: \\\"Particle Connectkit App\\\", description: \\\"Generated by create next app\\\", }; export default function RootLayout({ children, }: Readonly<{ children: React.ReactNode; }>) { return ( <html lang=\\\"en\\\"> <body className={inter.className}> <ParticleConnectkit>{children}</ParticleConnectkit> </body> </html> ); }\\nBuilding the Application \\nWith your project set up, dependencies installed, and Particle Connect configured, you can start building in the page.tsx file.\\nIn page.tsx, you’ll define the core features: login flow, data visualization, transaction handling, and the UI.\\nConnecting the Wallet \\nWith layout.tsx set up, the next step is to add a main Connect Wallet button for user login. Import ConnectButton from @particle-network/connectkit and add it to the interface. Once the user logs in, the ConnectButton transforms into an embedded wallet widget.\\n\\\"use client\\\"; import { ConnectButton, useAccount } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit\\\"; const HomePage = () => { const { address, isConnected, chainId } = useAccount(); return ( <div className=\\\"flex justify-center items-center h-screen\\\"> <div className=\\\"text-center\\\"> <ConnectButton /> {isConnected && ( <> <h2>Address: {address}</h2> <h2>Chain ID: {chainId}</h2> </> )} </div> </div> ); }; export default HomePage;\\nSending Transactions with an EIP-1193 Provider \\nParticle Connect offers built-in AA features, but pairing it with the Particle AA SDK lets you leverage EIP-1193 providers like ethers. This setup is particularly useful if you’re already accustomed to these providers or if you’re integrating Particle Connect into an existing application.\\nTo set this up, wrap the smart account from Particle Connect within an ethers instance to create a customProvider. This lets you interact with ethers as usual while the smart account manages transaction signing in the background.\\nimport {useSmartAccount } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit\\\"; import { AAWrapProvider, SendTransactionMode } from \\\"@particle-network/aa\\\"; const smartAccount = useSmartAccount(); // Init custom provider with gasless transaction mode const customProvider = smartAccount ? new ethers.BrowserProvider( new AAWrapProvider( smartAccount, SendTransactionMode.Gasless ) as Eip1193Provider, \\\"any\\\" ) : null; /** * Sends a transaction using the ethers.js library. * This transaction is gasless since the customProvider is initialized as gasless */ const executeTxEthers = async () => { if (!customProvider) return; const signer = await customProvider.getSigner(); const tx = { to: recipientAddress, value: parseEther(\\\"0.01\\\").toString(), }; const txResponse = await signer.sendTransaction(tx); const txReceipt = await txResponse.wait(); console.log(txReceipt?.hash) };\\nThis transaction is gasless due to two factors:\\nGasless Mode: Setting SendTransactionMode.Gasless in AAWrapProvider specifies a sponsored transaction.\\nFunding: On Testnets like Mantle Sepolia, transactions are automatically sponsored, so no USDT is needed. On mainnets, the Paymaster (configured in the Particle dashboard) must be funded to cover transaction fees.\\nThis example uses an EIP-1193 provider, though you can also create a userOp directly with Particle Connect. For details, see the starter repository.\\nFull App Example \\nWith an understanding of each part, you can now use Particle Connect, as shown in the example application below.\\nThis application creates a smart account on Mantle Sepolia through either social or Web3 login and sends a gasless transaction of 0.01 MNT using the ethers provider.\\n\\\"use client\\\"; import React, { useEffect, useState } from \\\"react\\\"; // Particle imports import { ConnectButton, useAccount, usePublicClient, useSmartAccount, } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit\\\"; // Eip1193 and AA Provider import { AAWrapProvider, SendTransactionMode } from \\\"@particle-network/aa\\\"; // Only needed with Eip1193 provider import { ethers, type Eip1193Provider } from \\\"ethers\\\"; import { formatEther, parseEther } from \\\"viem\\\"; export default function Home() { const { isConnected, chain } = useAccount(); const publicClient = usePublicClient(); const smartAccount = useSmartAccount(); const [userAddress, setUserAddress] = useState<string>(\\\"\\\"); const [balance, setBalance] = useState<string | null>(null); const [recipientAddress, setRecipientAddress] = useState<string>(\\\"\\\"); const [transactionHash, setTransactionHash] = useState<string | null>(null); // Init custom provider with gasless transaction mode const customProvider = smartAccount ? new ethers.BrowserProvider( new AAWrapProvider( smartAccount, SendTransactionMode.Gasless ) as Eip1193Provider, \\\"any\\\" ) : null; /** * Fetches the balance of a given address. * @param {string} address - The address to fetch the balance for. */ const fetchBalance = async (address: string) => { try { const balanceResponse = await publicClient?.getBalance({ address: address as `0x${string}`, }); if (balanceResponse) { const balanceInEther = formatEther(balanceResponse).toString(); setBalance(balanceInEther); } else { setBalance(\\\"0.0\\\"); } } catch (error) { console.error(\\\"Error fetching balance:\\\", error); setBalance(\\\"0.0\\\"); } }; /** * Loads the user's account data, including address and balance. */ useEffect(() => { const loadAccountData = async () => { if (isConnected && smartAccount) { try { const address = await smartAccount.getAddress(); setUserAddress(address); await fetchBalance(address); } catch (error) { console.error(\\\"Error loading account data:\\\", error); } } }; loadAccountData(); }, [isConnected, smartAccount]); /** * Sends a transaction using the ethers.js library. * This transaction is gasless since the customProvider is initialized as gasless */ const executeTxEthers = async () => { if (!customProvider) return; const signer = await customProvider.getSigner(); try { const tx = { to: recipientAddress, value: parseEther(\\\"0.01\\\").toString(), }; const txResponse = await signer.sendTransaction(tx); const txReceipt = await txResponse.wait(); setTransactionHash(txReceipt?.hash || null); } catch (error) { console.error(\\\"Failed to send transaction using ethers.js:\\\", error); } }; return ( <div className=\\\"container min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-center items-center mx-auto gap-4 px-4 md:px-8\\\"> <div className=\\\"w-full flex justify-center mt-4\\\"> <ConnectButton label=\\\"Click to login\\\" /> </div> {isConnected && ( <> <div className=\\\"border border-purple-500 p-6 rounded-lg w-full\\\"> <h2 className=\\\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white\\\"> Address: <code>{userAddress || \\\"Loading...\\\"}</code> </h2> <h2 className=\\\"text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white\\\"> Balance: {balance || \\\"Loading...\\\"} {chain?.nativeCurrency.symbol} </h2> <input type=\\\"text\\\" placeholder=\\\"Recipient Address\\\" value={recipientAddress} onChange={(e) => setRecipientAddress(e.target.value)} className=\\\"mt-4 p-3 w-full rounded border border-gray-700 bg-gray-900 text-white focus:outline-none\\\" /> <button className=\\\"bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded mt-4\\\" onClick={executeTxEthers} disabled={!recipientAddress} > Send 0.001 {chain?.nativeCurrency.name} </button> {transactionHash && ( <p className=\\\"text-green-500 mt-4\\\"> Transaction Hash: {transactionHash} </p> )} </div> </> )} </div> ); }\\nParticle Connect Hooks \\nThis example demonstrates a basic usage of Particle Connect. For the complete list of hooks, see the Particle Connect documentation.\",\n  \"markdown\": \"# Social Login by Using Particle\\n\\nParticle Network offers Wallet Abstraction services through its Account Abstraction stack, optimizing user onboarding with a set of SDKs. Comment Edit from here\\n\\nIntegrating customizable modules for Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Account Abstraction (AA), Particle facilitates quick onboarding in just 2-clicks via social login options like Google, email, and phone, alongside traditional Web3 login methods.\\n\\nParticle Network is compatible with Mantle Mainnet and Testnet, supporting EOA interactions and native ERC-4337 via implementations like SimpleAccount, Biconomy V2, and Cyber Connect.\\n\\nThis tutorial guides you through the steps for building a demo application on Mantle Sepolia using the [Particle Connect SDK](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/connect/desktop/web) — Particle's flagship onboarding SDK. The Particle Connect SDK enables quick 2-click onboarding with social and Web3 login options in a single modal. In this demo, we'll onboard users through a SimpleAccount instance of a smart account via social login and execute a gasless (sponsored) transaction.\\n\\n## \\n\\nGetting Started\\n\\nThis tutorial is based on a [Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to demonstrate wallet creation on Mantle using social logins.\\n\\nThe Particle Connect SDK simplifies wallet creation, user authentication, and blockchain interactions, providing a streamlined interface that supports social logins and traditional Web3 wallets.\\n\\n### \\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nTo integrate Particle Connect into your Mantle application, you'll need just a few dependencies. Particle Connect includes built-in Account Abstraction (AA) support, but in this example, we’ll also install the [Particle AA SDK](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/aa/sdks/desktop/web) to use EIP-1193 providers like ethers.\\n\\n```\\nyarn add @particle-network/connectkit viem@^2 @particle-network/aa ethers\\n```\\n\\n### \\n\\nConfiguring the Particle Dashboard\\n\\nTo get started with the setup, visit the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/) to retrieve three essential values for your project.\\n\\nWhen using any Particle Network SDK, you'll need a projectId, clientKey, and appId to authenticate your project and establish a connection between your Particle Auth instance and the Particle dashboard. This setup allows you to customize in-app modals, track users, manage your Paymaster funds, and more.\\n\\nOnce you're in the Particle dashboard, follow these steps:\\n\\nGo to **Add New Project** to create a new project.\\n\\nChoose a name and domain for your app. You can use a placeholder here if you haven't finalized your deployment domain.\\n\\nCopy your **Project ID**, **Client Key**, and **App ID**.\\n\\nFor security, it's best to store these values in a .env file in this format:\\n\\n```\\nNEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID='PROJECT_ID'\\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY='CLIENT_KEY'\\nNEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID='APP_ID'\\nNEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID='WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID'\\n```\\n\\n## \\n\\nConfiguring Particle Connect\\n\\nFirst, let’s configure and initialize Particle Connect. Create a new file called `ConnectKit.tsx` in your `src` directory. In this file, we’ll define the `ParticleConnectKit` component, which wraps the configured `ConnectKitProvider` instance and acts as the primary interface for handling configuration.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"use client\\\";\\n\\nimport React from \\\"react\\\";\\nimport { ConnectKitProvider, createConfig } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit\\\";\\nimport { authWalletConnectors } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit/auth\\\";\\nimport { evmWalletConnectors } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit/evm\\\";\\nimport { mantleSepoliaTestnet } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit/chains\\\";\\nimport { wallet, EntryPosition } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit/wallet\\\";\\nimport { aa } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit/aa\\\";\\n\\nconst config = createConfig({\\n  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID!,\\n  clientKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY!,\\n  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID!,\\n\\n  walletConnectors: [\\n    authWalletConnectors({}), // Social logins\\n\\n    // Default Web3 logins\\n    evmWalletConnectors({\\n      walletConnectProjectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID, // optional, retrieved from https://cloud.walletconnect.com\\n    }),\\n  ],\\n\\n  plugins: [\\n    wallet({\\n      entryPosition: EntryPosition.BR, // Positions the modal button at the bottom right on login\\n      visible: true, // Determines if the wallet modal is displayed\\n    }),\\n    aa({\\n      name: \\\"SIMPLE\\\",\\n      version: \\\"2.0.0\\\",\\n    }),\\n  ],\\n  chains: [mantleSepoliaTestnet],\\n});\\n\\nexport const ParticleConnectkit = ({ children }: React.PropsWithChildren) => {\\n  return <ConnectKitProvider config={config}>{children}</ConnectKitProvider>;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis code configures Particle Connect to enable wallet authentication and blockchain interactions on Mantle Sepolia. It supports social logins and standard Web3 options via WalletConnect and includes Account Abstraction (AA) with a `simpleAccount` instance, version 2.0.0. The configured `ConnectKitProvider` component wraps the app’s content, ensuring this setup is accessible throughout the application.\\n\\n## \\n\\nIntegrate Particle Connect in Your App\\n\\nAfter configuration, wrap your application with the `ParticleConnectKit` component to provide access to the Particle Connect SDK across the app. Update the `layout.tsx` file in the `src` directory as follows:\\n\\n```\\nimport { ParticleConnectkit } from \\\"@/components/Connectkit\\\";\\nimport type { Metadata } from \\\"next\\\";\\nimport { Inter } from \\\"next/font/google\\\";\\nimport \\\"./globals.css\\\";\\n\\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: [\\\"latin\\\"] });\\n\\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\\n  title: \\\"Particle Connectkit App\\\",\\n  description: \\\"Generated by create next app\\\",\\n};\\n\\nexport default function RootLayout({\\n  children,\\n}: Readonly<{\\n  children: React.ReactNode;\\n}>) {\\n  return (\\n    <html lang=\\\"en\\\">\\n      <body className={inter.className}>\\n        <ParticleConnectkit>{children}</ParticleConnectkit>\\n      </body>\\n    </html>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## \\n\\nBuilding the Application\\n\\nWith your project set up, dependencies installed, and Particle Connect configured, you can start building in the `page.tsx` file.\\n\\nIn `page.tsx`, you’ll define the core features: login flow, data visualization, transaction handling, and the UI.\\n\\n### \\n\\nConnecting the Wallet\\n\\nWith `layout.tsx` set up, the next step is to add a main **Connect Wallet** button for user login. Import `ConnectButton` from `@particle-network/connectkit` and add it to the interface.

For this tutorial, we will be using “wagmi” as our preferred Ethereum library. \\nnpm install @reown/appkit @reown/appkit-wagmi-adapter wagmi @tanstack/react-query\\nReown also supports wagmi v1, ethers, ethers v5, if you want to use other sdk, please refer to their documentation here.\\nCreate a New Project on Reown Cloud\\nNow, we need to get a project Id from Reown Cloud that we will use to set up AppKit with Wagmi config. Navigate to cloud.reown.com and sign in. If you have not created an account yet, please do so before we proceed.\\nAfter you have logged in, please navigate to the “Projects” section of the Cloud and click on “Create Project”.\\nNow, enter the name for your project and click on “Continue”.\\nSelect the product as “AppKit” and click on “Continue”.\\nSelect the framework as “Next.js” and click on “Create”. Reown Cloud will now create a new project for you which will also generate a project Id.\\nYou will notice that your project was successfully created. On the top left corner, you will be able to find your Project Id. Please copy that as you will need that later.\\nYou will notice that your project was successfully created. On the top left corner, you will be able to find your Project Id. Please copy that as you will need that later.\\nBuild the App Using AppKit\\nBefore we build the app, let’s first configure our .env file. On the root level of your code directory, create a new file named .env.\\nOpen that file and create a new variable NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID. You will assign the project Id that you copied in the previous step to this environment variable that you just created. This is what it will look like:\\nNEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID = <YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE>\\nPlease make sure you follow the best practices when you are working with secret keys and other sensitive information. Environment variables that start with NEXT_PUBLIC will be exposed by your app which can be misused by bad actors.\\nConfigure AppKit\\nOn the root level of your code directory, create a new folder named config and within that folder, create a new code file named config/index.tsx. Now, paste the code snippet shared below inside the code file, i.e., config/index.tsx.TypeScriptCopy\\nimport { WagmiAdapter } from \\\"@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi\\\"; import { cookieStorage, createStorage } from \\\"wagmi\\\"; import { mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet } from '@reown/appkit/networks' // Get projectId from https://cloud.reown.com export const projectId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID; export const networks = [mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet] if (!projectId) throw new Error(\\\"Project ID is not defined\\\"); // Set up the Wagmi Adapter (config) export const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({ storage: createStorage({ storage: cookieStorage }), ssr: true, networks, projectId }) export const config = wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig\\nSo what's happening in the above code? Let's understand it step-by-step:\\nFirst, we need to import the necessary functions from their respective packages.\\nWagmiAdapter - this is used to create a WAGMI configuration which is then initialized to the wagmiAdapter\\ncookieStorage, createStorage - this provides a storage mechanism using cookies and a function to create custom storage solutions (in this case, using cookies).\\nCreate the Modal for your app\\nNow, we need to create a context provider to wrap our application in and initialize AppKit.\\nOn the root level of your code directory, create a new folder named context and within that folder, create a new code file named context/index.tsx. Now, paste the code snippet shared below inside the code file, i.e., context/index.tsx.\\n'use client' import { wagmiAdapter, projectId } from '@/config' import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit/react' import { mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet } from '@reown/appkit/networks' import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query' import React, { type ReactNode } from 'react' import { cookieToInitialState, WagmiProvider, type Config } from 'wagmi' // Set up queryClient const queryClient = new QueryClient() if (!projectId) { throw new Error('Project ID is not defined') } // Set up metadata const metadata = { //this is optional name: \\\"appkit-example-mantle\\\", description: \\\"AppKit Example - Mantle\\\", url: \\\"https://mantleapp.com\\\", // origin must match your domain & subdomain icons: [\\\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179229932\\\"] } // Create the modal const modal = createAppKit({ adapters: [wagmiAdapter], projectId, networks: [mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet], metadata: metadata, features: { analytics: true, // Optional - defaults to your Cloud configuration }, themeMode: 'light' }) function ContextProvider({ children, cookies }: { children: ReactNode; cookies: string | null }) { const initialState = cookieToInitialState(wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig as Config, cookies) return ( <WagmiProvider config={wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig as Config} initialState={initialState}> <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider> </WagmiProvider> ) } export default ContextProvider\\nLet’s understand what is happening in the above code:\\nFirst, we import the necessary functions from their respective packages. After this, we need to create the modal component for our app.\\nmetadata - This object contains information about our application that will be used by AppKit. This includes the name of the app, the description, the url and the icons representing our app. This is optional.\\ncreateAppKit - this is called to initialize the AppKit component, which handles the user interface for connecting to blockchain wallets. The function is configured with various options, such as the app's metadata, theming, and enabling features like analytics and onramp services.\\nnetworks - these are the networks that we want our app to support. So import the chains you want your app to support from @reown/appkit/network and assign it to this network parameter. Since we want to enable wallet interactions on the Mantle network, we import both Mantle Mainnet and the Sepolia testnet. You can view the complete list of supported chains here.\\nWagmiProvider: Provides blockchain and wallet connection context to the app.\\nQueryClientProvider: Provides the React Query context for managing server-state data.\\nNow, let’s create the layout for our app. In app/layout.tsx, remove the existing code and paste the code snippet given below.\\nimport type { Metadata } from \\\"next\\\"; import { Inter } from \\\"next/font/google\\\"; import \\\"./globals.css\\\"; const inter = Inter({ subsets: [\\\"latin\\\"] }); import { headers } from \\\"next/headers\\\"; // added import ContextProvider from '@/context' export const metadata: Metadata = { title: \\\"AppKit Example App\\\", description: \\\"Powered by Reown\\\" }; export default function RootLayout({ children }: Readonly<{ children: React.ReactNode }>) { const cookies = headers().get('cookie') return ( <html lang=\\\"en\\\"> <body className={inter.className}> <ContextProvider cookies={cookies}>{children}</ContextProvider> </body> </html> ) }\\nCreate the UI for your app\\nFor our app to have the UI with which your users can interact, you need to set a simple UI and configure the modal. Since, we have already set up AppKit, you can use <w3m-button> which will serve as a “Connect Wallet” button or you can build your own custom button using the hooks that AppKit provides.\\nOpen the app/page.tsx file and remove the existing boilerplate code, and then replace it with the code snippet given below.\\n\\\"use client\\\"; import { useAccount } from \\\"wagmi\\\"; export default function Home() { const { isConnected } = useAccount(); return ( <main className=\\\"min-h-screen px-8 py-0 pb-12 flex-1 flex flex-col items-center\\\"> <header className=\\\"w-full py-4 flex justify-between items-center\\\"> <div className=\\\"flex items-center\\\"> <img src=\\\"/walletconnect.png\\\" alt=\\\"logo\\\" className=\\\"w-10 h-10 mr-2\\\" /> <div className=\\\"hidden sm:inline text-xl font-bold\\\">Reown - AppKit + Mantle</div> </div> </header> <h2 className=\\\"my-8 text-2xl font-bold leading-snug text-center\\\">Examples</h2> <div className=\\\"max-w-4xl\\\"> <div className=\\\"grid bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-sm\\\"> <h3 className=\\\"text-sm font-semibold bg-gray-100 p-2 text-center\\\">Connect your wallet</h3> <div className=\\\"flex justify-center items-center p-4\\\"> <w3m-button /> </div> </div> <br></br> {isConnected && ( <div className=\\\"grid bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-sm\\\"> <h3 className=\\\"text-sm font-semibold bg-gray-100 p-2 text-center\\\">Network selection button</h3> <div className=\\\"flex justify-center items-center p-4\\\"> <w3m-network-button /> </div> </div> )} </div> </main> ); }\\nThe code above uses the AppKit configuration to provide two buttons: one for users to connect their wallet to the app, and another to allow users to switch networks.\\nYou can now run the app and test it out. In order to do so, run the command given below.\\nConclusion\\nAnd that’s it! You have now learned how to create a simple app using AppKit that allows users to connect their wallet and interact with the Mantle network.\\nReown AppKit is a powerful solution for developers looking to integrate wallet connections and other Web3 functionalities into their apps on any EVM chain.

Now, paste the code snippet shared below inside the code file, i.e., `context/index.tsx`.\\n\\n```\\n'use client'\\n\\nimport { wagmiAdapter, projectId } from '@/config'\\nimport { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit/react' \\nimport { mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet } from '@reown/appkit/networks'\\n\\nimport { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'\\nimport React, { type ReactNode } from 'react'\\nimport { cookieToInitialState, WagmiProvider, type Config } from 'wagmi'\\n\\n// Set up queryClient\\nconst queryClient = new QueryClient()\\n\\nif (!projectId) {\\n  throw new Error('Project ID is not defined')\\n}\\n\\n// Set up metadata\\nconst metadata = { //this is optional\\n  name: \\\"appkit-example-mantle\\\",\\n  description: \\\"AppKit Example - Mantle\\\",\\n  url: \\\"https://mantleapp.com\\\", // origin must match your domain & subdomain\\n  icons: [\\\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179229932\\\"]\\n}\\n\\n// Create the modal\\nconst modal = createAppKit({\\n  adapters: [wagmiAdapter],\\n  projectId,\\n  networks: [mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet],\\n  metadata: metadata,\\n  features: {\\n    analytics: true, // Optional - defaults to your Cloud configuration\\n  },\\n  themeMode: 'light'\\n})\\n\\nfunction ContextProvider({ children, cookies }: { children: ReactNode; cookies: string | null }) {\\n  const initialState = cookieToInitialState(wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig as Config, cookies)\\n\\n  return (\\n    <WagmiProvider config={wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig as Config} initialState={initialState}>\\n      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>\\n    </WagmiProvider>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\nexport default ContextProvider\\n```\\n\\nLet’s understand what is happening in the above code:\\n\\nFirst, we import the necessary functions from their respective packages. After this, we need to create the modal component for our app.\\n\\n*   **metadata** - This object contains information about our application that will be used by AppKit. This includes the name of the app, the description, the url and the icons representing our app. **This is optional.**\\n    \\n*   `createAppKit` - this is called to initialize the AppKit component, which handles the user interface for connecting to blockchain wallets. The function is configured with various options, such as the app's metadata, theming, and enabling features like analytics and onramp services.\\n    \\n*   **networks -** these are the networks that we want our app to support. So import the chains you want your app to support from `@reown/appkit/network` and assign it to this network parameter. Since we want to enable wallet interactions on the Mantle network, we import both Mantle Mainnet and the Sepolia testnet. You can view the complete list of supported chains [here](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/chains).\\n    \\n*   **WagmiProvider**: Provides blockchain and wallet connection context to the app.\\n    \\n*   **QueryClientProvider**: Provides the React Query context for managing server-state data.\\n    \\n\\nNow, let’s create the layout for our app. In `app/layout.tsx`, remove the existing code and paste the code snippet given below.\\n\\n```\\nimport type { Metadata } from \\\"next\\\";\\nimport { Inter } from \\\"next/font/google\\\";\\nimport \\\"./globals.css\\\";\\n\\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: [\\\"latin\\\"] });\\n\\nimport { headers } from \\\"next/headers\\\"; // added\\nimport ContextProvider from '@/context'\\n\\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\\n  title: \\\"AppKit Example App\\\",\\n  description: \\\"Powered by Reown\\\"\\n};\\n\\nexport default function RootLayout({\\n  children\\n}: Readonly<{\\n  children: React.ReactNode\\n}>) {\\n  const cookies = headers().get('cookie')\\n\\n  return (\\n    <html lang=\\\"en\\\">\\n      <body className={inter.className}>\\n        <ContextProvider cookies={cookies}>{children}</ContextProvider>\\n      </body>\\n    </html>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### \\n\\nCreate the UI for your app\\n\\nFor our app to have the UI with which your users can interact, you need to set a simple UI and configure the modal. Since, we have already set up AppKit, you can use <w3m-button> which will serve as a “Connect Wallet” button or you can build your own custom button using the [hooks](https://docs.walletconnect.com/appkit/next/core/hooks) that AppKit provides.\\n\\nOpen the app/page.tsx file and remove the existing boilerplate code, and then replace it with the code snippet given below.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"use client\\\";\\nimport { useAccount } from \\\"wagmi\\\";\\n\\nexport default function Home() {\\n  const { isConnected } = useAccount();\\n\\n  return (\\n    <main className=\\\"min-h-screen px-8 py-0 pb-12 flex-1 flex flex-col items-center\\\">\\n      <header className=\\\"w-full py-4 flex justify-between items-center\\\">\\n        <div className=\\\"flex items-center\\\">\\n          <img src=\\\"/walletconnect.png\\\" alt=\\\"logo\\\" className=\\\"w-10 h-10 mr-2\\\" />\\n          <div className=\\\"hidden sm:inline text-xl font-bold\\\">Reown - AppKit + Mantle</div>\\n        </div>\\n      </header>\\n      <h2 className=\\\"my-8 text-2xl font-bold leading-snug text-center\\\">Examples</h2>\\n      <div className=\\\"max-w-4xl\\\">\\n        <div className=\\\"grid bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-sm\\\">\\n          <h3 className=\\\"text-sm font-semibold bg-gray-100 p-2 text-center\\\">Connect your wallet</h3>\\n          <div className=\\\"flex justify-center items-center p-4\\\">\\n          <w3m-button />\\n          </div>\\n        </div> \\n        <br></br>\\n        {isConnected && (\\n          <div className=\\\"grid bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-sm\\\">\\n            <h3 className=\\\"text-sm font-semibold bg-gray-100 p-2 text-center\\\">Network selection button</h3>\\n            <div className=\\\"flex justify-center items-center p-4\\\">\\n              <w3m-network-button />\\n            </div>\\n          </div>\\n        )}\\n      </div>\\n    </main>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe code above uses the AppKit configuration to provide two buttons: one for users to connect their wallet to the app, and another to allow users to switch networks.\\n\\nYou can now run the app and test it out. In order to do so, run the command given below.\\n\\n### \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAnd that’s it!

As a result, they are also referred to as assertions, as their validity is not predetermined. The verification logic relies on evidence of invalid state transitions to initiate the validation process, with fraud proofs serving as the medium to provide such evidence. The protocol allows for a dispute window during which network participants can come forward to submit fraud proofs disputing states they believe to be incorrect. For most Optimistic rollup protocols, this challenge period typically lasts around 7 days. By default, any transactions without disputes within this timeframe are considered valid.\\nTypes of Fraud Proofs​\\nFraud proofs can be categorized into two distinct types: non-interactive and interactive.\\nNon-Interactive Fraud Proofs​\\nNon-interactive fraud proofs use a method where no other parties are needed to prove the incorrectness of an assertion. They basically run all the state transitions between two assertions to establish whether the resultant state is consistent or not. They are simpler to design and implement, but they place limitations on the size of assertions, since the assertions need to be small enough to run with the computational capabilities of the current EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) architecture.\\nInteractive Fraud Proofs​\\nInteractive fraud proofs, on the other hand, involve two or more parties that work in tandem to verify an assertion, i.e., a party claiming a fraudulent assertion, and a party defending the said assertion. The verifier narrows down the assertion to a single state transition by interacting with the challenger, and eventually only verifies that one transition to establish its validity.

It facilitates EVM-equivalent fault proofs as part of an interactive dispute by employing op-geth to execute on-chain instructions one at a time. This process involves on-chain contracts paired with an off-chain simulator.\\nWhy do we need this in Mantle?​\\nIn popular fraud-proof models currently, the contracts responsible for resolving disputes — on-chain validators — can only execute instructions in lower-level virtual machines like MIPS or WASM. This compels the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) client (e.g., op-geth) to recompile fraud proofs into a lower-level language (e.g., MIPs-opcode) for on-chain validators to interpret. Thus, Cannon implements an on-chain contract to simulate MIPs-opcode, enabling the verification of MIPs instructions' execution in the EVM environment. Simultaneously, it implements an off-chain simulator to generate proofs for any MIPS instruction, completing on-chain verification.\\nMantle network will use the fraud proof model implemented by Cannon.

As a result, they are also referred to as assertions, as their validity is not predetermined. The verification logic relies on evidence of invalid state transitions to initiate the validation process, with fraud proofs serving as the medium to provide such evidence. The protocol allows for a dispute window during which network participants can come forward to submit fraud proofs disputing states they believe to be incorrect. For most [Optimistic rollup](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/more/glossary#optimistic-rollup) protocols, this challenge period typically lasts around 7 days. By default, any transactions without disputes within this timeframe are considered valid.\\n\\n## \\n\\nTypes of Fraud Proofs[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/intro/risk-management/fp#types-of-fraud-proofs)\\n\\nFraud proofs can be categorized into two distinct types: **non-interactive** and **interactive**.\\n\\n### \\n\\nNon-Interactive Fraud Proofs[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/intro/risk-management/fp#non-interactive-fraud-proofs)\\n\\nNon-interactive fraud proofs use a method where no other parties are needed to prove the incorrectness of an assertion. They basically run all the state transitions between two assertions to establish whether the resultant state is consistent or not. They are simpler to design and implement, but they place limitations on the size of assertions, since the assertions need to be small enough to run with the computational capabilities of the current EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) architecture.\\n\\n### \\n\\nInteractive Fraud Proofs[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/intro/risk-management/fp#interactive-fraud-proofs)\\n\\nInteractive fraud proofs, on the other hand, involve two or more parties that work in tandem to verify an assertion, i.e., a party claiming a fraudulent assertion, and a party defending the said assertion.

The challenge period will be much shorter in the testnet (~40 minutes) than in the mainnet (7 days).\\n\\nThis tutorial teaches you how to use the Mantle SDK to transfer MNT between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2). Check the complete code [here](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-tutorial/blob/main/cross-dom-bridge-mnt/index.js).\\n\\n## \\n\\nSetup[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/how-to/bridge-mnt#setup)\\n\\n1.  Ensure your computer has:\\n    \\n2.  Start L1 and L2 environments. Currently, we support the local environment or the testnet environment. If you want to deploy your own L1 and L2, please follow the instructions below.\\n    \\n    ```\\n    git clone https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2.git\\n    cd mantle/ops\\n    make up\\n    # check status\\n    make ps\\n    ```\\n    \\n    **We highly recommend using the testnet environment, which means you can skip this step, you can apply your own L1 RPC** [**here**](https://www.alchemy.com/) **and replace the L1 RPC URL in the** `**.env**` **file.**\\n    \\n3.  Clone this repository and enter it.\\n    \\n    ```\\n    git clone https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-tutorial.git\\n    cd mantle-tutorial/cross-dom-bridge-mnt\\n    ```\\n    \\n4.  Install the necessary packages.\\n    \\n\\n## \\n\\nRun the Sample Code[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/how-to/bridge-mnt#run-the-sample-code)\\n\\nThe sample code is in the `index.js`, the whole execution flow will automatically start after running it.\\n\\n### \\n\\nNode Environment[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/how-to/bridge-mnt#node-environment)\\n\\nIf you want to test by using your own nodes, you should configure the missing or changing environment variables in file `.env.local.tmp` then use `yarn local` to execute `index.js`.\\n\\nIf you want to have a test in our testnet network you should do the same for `.env.testnet.tmp` and then use `yarn testnet` to execute `index.js`.\\n\\n## \\n\\nHow Does It Work?[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/how-to/bridge-mnt#how-does-it-work)\\n\\n### \\n\\nImport the Necessary Libraries[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/how-to/bridge-mnt#import-the-necessary-libraries)\\n\\n```\\nconst ethers = require('ethers');\\nconst mantleSDK = require('@mantleio/sdk');\\nconst fs = require('fs');\\n```\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we initialize the required libraries:\\n\\n*   `ethers`: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides an easy-to-use interface for tasks like creating wallets, sending transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.\\n    \\n*   `mantleSDK`: The Mantle SDK, which facilitates cross-chain transactions between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchains. It abstracts away complexities, making it easier to perform operations like depositing and withdrawing assets.\\n    \\n*   `fs`: The Node.js `fs` module for file system operations. It may be used later in the code for reading or writing files, although it's not explicitly used in the provided snippet.\\n    \\n\\n### \\n\\nNetwork Configuration and Wallet Setup[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/how-to/bridge-mnt#network-configuration-and-wallet-setup)\\n\\nNext, the code defines some configuration parameters. We fetch the specified network and wallet configurations from the `.env` file.\\n\\n```\\nconst L1TestERC20 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('TestERC20.json'));\\nconst l1MntAddr = process.env.L1_MNT;\\nconst l2MntAddr = process.env.L2_MNT;\\nconst key = process.env.PRIV_KEY;\\n```\\n\\n*   `L1TestERC20`: A JSON object representing the L1 Test ERC20 contract.\\n    \\n*   `l1MntAddr`: The address of the L1 MNT token.\\n    \\n*   `l2MntAddr`: The address of the L2 MNT token.\\n    \\n*   `key`: The private key retrieved from the environment variables.\\n    \\n\\n```\\n// Global variable because we need them almost everywhere\\nlet crossChainMessenger;\\nlet ourAddr; // Our address\\n```\\n\\n*   `crossChainMessenger`: A global variable initialized later in the `setup` function, representing the Mantle SDK's `CrossChainMessenger` object.\\n    \\n*   `ourAddr`: A variable that will store the user's address.\\n    \\n\\nThen create wallet objects by passing the private key and RPC addresses as parameters for L1 and L2.\\n\\n```\\nconst l1RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.L1_RPC);\\nconst l2RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.L2_RPC);\\nconst l1Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(key, l1RpcProvider);\\nconst l2Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(key, l2RpcProvider);\\n```\\n\\n### \\n\\nSetup CrossChainMessenger Object[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/how-to/bridge-mnt#setup-crosschainmessenger-object)\\n\\nThe `CrossChainMessenger` object calls the cross chain messenger contracts on L1 and L2 to transfer assets. Here we instantiate the object with chain IDs, wallet objects, and contract objects.\\n\\n```\\nconst setup = async () => {\\n  ourAddr = l1Wallet.address;\\n  crossChainMessenger = new mantleSDK.CrossChainMessenger({\\n    l1ChainId: process.env.L1_CHAINID,\\n    l2ChainId: process.env.L2_CHAINID,\\n    l1SignerOrProvider: l1Wallet,\\n    l2SignerOrProvider: l2Wallet,\\n    bedrock: true,\\n  });\\n  l1Mnt = new ethers.Contract(l1MntAddr, L1TestERC20.abi, l1Wallet);\\n};\\n```\\n\\n### \\n\\nReport the Balances[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/how-to/bridge-mnt#report-the-balances)\\n\\nThe `reportBalances` function fetches L1 and L2 wallet balances and prints them out. We'll use this method to keep track balance change after deposit and withdraw operations.\\n\\n```\\nconst reportBalances = async () => {\\n  const l1Balance = (await l1Mnt.balanceOf(ourAddr)).toString().slice(0, -18);\\n  const l2Balance = (await crossChainMessenger.l2Signer.getBalance())\\n    .toString()\\n    .slice(0, -18);\\n  console.log(`Token on L1:${l1Balance}     Token on L2:${l2Balance}`);\\n};\\n```\\n\\n### \\n\\nDeposit[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/how-to/bridge-mnt#deposit)\\n\\nThe `depositMNT` function deposits 1 MNT token to L2 via the Mantle bridge. The asynchronous function prints out the transaction hash and waits for the message to get relayed. Finally, we display the updated MNT balance on L1 and L2.\\n\\nTo show that the deposit actually happened we show before and after balances.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log('#################### Deposit MNT ####################');\\nawait reportBalances();\\n```\\n\\nWe need to make sure the allowance is approved. We can do that by sending an approval transaction on L1.\\n\\n```\\n// Need the l2 address to know which bridge is responsible\\nconst allowanceResponse = await crossChainMessenger.approveERC20(\\n  l1MntAddr,\\n  l2MntAddr,\\n  depositToken,\\n);\\nawait allowanceResponse.wait();\\n```\\n\\n`crossChainMessenger.depositMNT()` creates and sends the deposit transaction on L1.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\n\\nconst response = await crossChainMessenger.depositMNT(depositToken);\\n```\\n\\nOf course, it takes time for the transaction to actually be processed on L1.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log(`Deposit transaction hash (on L1): ${response.hash}`);\\nawait response.wait();\\n```\\n\\nAfter the transaction is processed on L1 it needs to be picked up by an off-chain service and relayed to L2. To show that the deposit actually happened we need to wait until the message is relayed.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log('Waiting for status to change to RELAYED');\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\nawait crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(\\n  response.hash,\\n  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED,\\n);\\n```\\n\\nOnce the message is relayed the balance change on L2 is practically instantaneous. We can just report the balances and see that the L2 balance rose by 1.\\n\\n```\\nawait reportBalances();\\nconsole.log(`depositMNT took ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds\\\\n`);\\n```\\n\\n### \\n\\nWithdraw[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/how-to/bridge-mnt#withdraw)\\n\\nThis function shows how to withdraw MNT from L2 to L1. For deposits, it was enough to transfer 1 MNT to show that the L2 balance increases. However, in the case of withdrawals the withdrawing account needs to be paid for finalizing the message, which costs more than that.\\n\\nTo show that the withdrawal actually happened we show before and after balances.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log('#################### Withdraw MNT ####################');\\nawait reportBalances();\\n```\\n\\nThen we withdraw the token from L2.\\n\\n```\\nconst response = await crossChainMessenger.withdrawMNT(withdrawToken);\\nconsole.log(`Transaction hash (on L2): ${response.hash}`);\\nawait response.wait();\\n```\\n\\nWe need to wait until the message is ready to prove.\\n\\n```\\nconsole.log('Waiting for status to be READY_TO_PROVE');\\nconsole.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`);\\nawait crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(\\n  response.hash,\\n  mantleSDK.MessageStatus.READY_TO_PROVE,\\n);\\n```\\n\\nWait until the state that includes the transaction gets past the challenge period, at which time we can finalize (also known as claim) the transaction.

Third-party endpoints from infrastructure [providers](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-developers/resources-and-tooling/node-endpoints-and-providers).\\n    \\n\\n### \\n\\nAdd Mantle Network to Metamask Quickly[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/common/wallet#add-mantle-network-to-metamask-quickly)\\n\\nBased on the [JSON-RPC API](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/wallet_addethereumchain/) provided by Metamask, developers can implement the ability to add Mantle Network to Metamask with a single click.\\n\\n```\\nawait window.ethereum.request({\\n  \\\"method\\\": \\\"wallet_addEthereumChain\\\",\\n  \\\"params\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"blockExplorerUrls\\\": [\\n        \\\"https://mantlescan.xyz/\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"iconUrls\\\": [\\n        \\\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qLqZu2vZSkZcKf46YERoa9cF0NfURvcc/view?usp=drive_link\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"nativeCurrency\\\": {\\n        \\\"name\\\": \\\"MNT\\\",\\n        \\\"symbol\\\": \\\"MNT\\\",\\n        \\\"decimals\\\": 18\\n      },\\n      \\\"rpcUrls\\\": [\\n        \\\"https://rpc.mantle.xyz\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"chainId\\\": \\\"0x1388\\\",\\n      \\\"chainName\\\": \\\"Mantle\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## \\n\\nCanonical Token Addresses[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/common/wallet#canonical-token-addresses)\\n\\nThe ERC-20 contract address for a token on Mantle network may be different from the address for the same token on Ethereum. Mantle maintains [a token list](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-token-lists/blob/main/mantle.tokenlist.json) that includes known addresses for many popular tokens. For example, looking at the`$MNT` token, the Mantle token list returns the following addresses:\\n\\n0x3c3a81e81dc49a522a592e7622a7e711c06bf354\\n\\n0xDeadDeAddeAddEAddeadDEaDDEAdDeaDDeAD0000\\n\\n## \\n\\nTransaction Status[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/common/wallet#transaction-status)\\n\\nA transaction on Mantle network can be in one of these states:\\n\\n*   **Sequencer Confirmed:** The transaction has been accepted by the sequencer on Mantle (L2)\\n    \\n*   **Confirmed On-Chain:** The transaction has been written to Ethereum (L1)\\n    \\n\\nIf a transaction is a withdrawal, it can be in one of the following states:\\n\\n*   **Waiting:** Confirmed on L1, but still in the challenge period\\n    \\n*   **Ready to Prove:** Transaction is ready to be proved on L1 to initiate the challenge period\\n    \\n*   **Ready for Relay:** Transaction is out of the challenge period, and can be released by submitting a relay message\\n    \\n*   **Relayed:** A withdrawal is finalized, and the token is released from the bridge\\n    \\n\\nYou can use the [Mantle SDK](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2/tree/develop/packages/sdk) to find out your transaction status.\\n\\n## \\n\\nTransaction Fees[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/common/wallet#transaction-fees)\\n\\nMantle network aims to be EVM-compatible, you can see a summary of the few differences between Mantle and Ethereum [here](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/system-information/fee-mechanism).\\n\\n## \\n\\nEstimating Total Fees[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/common/wallet#estimating-total-fees)\\n\\nThe major portion of the total cost of a transaction on Mantle network comes from the cost of publishing the transaction to Ethereum. Unlike with L2 execution gas fees, users cannot specify a particular gas price or gas limit for this portion of their transaction cost when it rolls up to Ethereum.\\n\\nIn fact, this fee is automatically deducted from the user's `$MNT` balance on Mantle when the transaction is executed.\\n\\nMantle SDK provides an interface to get the total gas fee directly.\\n\\n## \\n\\nSending \\\"Max\\\" $MNT[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/common/wallet#sending-max-mnt)\\n\\nMany wallets allow users to send the maximum amount of a token available in the user's balance. This requires the fee for this transaction to be calculated in advance, and then deducted from the user's `$MNT` balance being sent.\\n\\nLast updated 3 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-developers/common-use-cases/adding-a-custom-bridge-to-mantle\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-developers/common-use-cases/adding-a-custom-bridge-to-mantle\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:32:33.998Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network\",\n    \"depth\": 1,\n    \"httpStatusCode\": 200\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-developers/common-use-cases/adding-a-custom-bridge-to-mantle\",\n    \"title\": \"Adding a Custom Bridge to Mantle | Network\",\n    \"description\": null,\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"Adding a Custom Bridge to Mantle | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/~gitbook/ogimage/cV2CIE5W2wkdKsyr6t6p\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:32:33 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html; charset=utf-8\",\n      \"cf-cache-status\": \"DYNAMIC\",\n      \"cache-control\": \"no-cache\",\n      \"link\": \"<https://static.gitbook.com>; rel=preconnect; crossorigin=\\\"\\\"\",\n      \"strict-transport-security\": \"max-age=31536000\",\n      \"vary\": \"RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, Next-Router-Prefetch, Accept-Encoding\",\n      \"cf-placement\": \"remote-ORD\",\n      \"content-security-policy\": \"default-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; script-src 'self' 'nonce-YTg1ZWJlZGQtZjk4OS00YjU1LTkwMTctMWQ3MDIyNGFhNzZh' 'strict-dynamic' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://static.gitbook.com https://integrations.gitbook.com https://cdn.iframe.ly; style-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline'; img-src * 'self' blob: data: files.gitbook.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; connect-src * 'self' integrations.gitbook.com app.gitbook.com api.gitbook.com srv.buysellads.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com https://static.gitbook.com; frame-src *; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; form-action 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; frame-ancestors https: ;\",\n      \"nel\": \"{\\\"success_fraction\\\":0, \\\"report_to\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\", \\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"referrer-policy\": \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\",\n      \"report-to\": \"{\\\"endpoints\\\":[{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\\\/report\\\\/v4?s=FoSdNQYTKMqSxn2sLbR%2FIattwkDoPOTt9XG6i80oPUf6okseY51SIvO2KZan%2B2A16%2BowWFQxUfD18KooSH71hyGwC2kJWgaAwWX3e%2Fvl0q857oaoqW5qjbMEpg%2BUJnFvmxsmS4fDfan9RJKdIEPD\\\"}], \\\"group\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\", \\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"x-content-type-options\": \"nosniff\",\n      \"x-edge-runtime\": \"1\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache\": \"miss\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache-tag\": \"release-10.9.1072, site:site_GuZBK\",\n      \"x-gitbook-version\": \"3d1eb53\",\n      \"x-http-method\": \"GET\",\n      \"x-matched-path\": \"/middleware/[[...pathname]]\",\n      \"server\": \"cloudflare\",\n      \"cf-ray\": \"9128115c7c254d56-FRA\",\n      \"content-encoding\": \"br\",\n      \"x-firefox-spdy\": \"h2\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"screenshotUrl\": null,\n  \"text\": \"Adding a Custom Bridge to Mantle\\nUsing the Standard Bridge​\\nWe suggest considering using the Standard Bridge first before deciding to develop a custom bridge solution.\\nIn the standard bridge when ERC-20 is deposited on layer 1 (L1) and transferred to the bridge contract, it remains \\\"locked\\\" there while the equivalent amount is minted in the layer 2 (L2) token.

The most common configuration is to have L1 as the layer of original mint, and L2 as the bridged layer, this allows for ERC-20 contracts that were written with no knowledge of Mantle Mainnet to be bridged. The contract on the bridged layer has to implement the legacy IL2StandardERC20 interface (only if the bridged layer is L2).\\nFor this to be done securely, the only entity that is allowed to mint and burn tokens on the bridged layer has to be the Standard Bridge, to ensure that the tokens on the bridged layer are backed up by real tokens on the layer of original mint.

The most common configuration is to have L1 as the layer of original mint, and L2 as the bridged layer, this allows for ERC-20 contracts that were written with no knowledge of Mantle Mainnet to be bridged. The contract on the bridged layer has to implement the legacy [`IL2StandardERC20`](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-erc20-bridge/blob/main/contracts/ERC20/IL2StandardERC20.sol) interface (only if the bridged layer is L2).\\n\\nFor this to be done securely, the _only_ entity that is allowed to mint and burn tokens on the bridged layer has to be the Standard Bridge, to ensure that the tokens on the bridged layer are backed up by real tokens on the layer of original mint. It is also necessary that the ERC-20 token contract on the layer of original mint _not_ implement either of the interfaces, to make sure the bridge contracts don't get confused and think it is the bridged layer.\\n\\n**Warning:** The standard bridge does _not_ support certain ERC-20 configurations:\\n\\nFor the purpose we import the `L2StandardERC20` from the `@mantleio/contracts` package.

Otherwise, it will exceed the user's balance and the transaction will fail.\\n\\nLast updated 11 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/concepts/modular-chains\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/concepts/modular-chains\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:32:40.170Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network?fallback=true\",\n    \"depth\": 2\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/concepts/modular-chains\",\n    \"title\": \"Modular Blockchain | Network\",\n    \"description\": \"Taking a modular chain approach to offer hyper-scaled transaction throughput\",\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"Modular Blockchain | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:description\",\n        \"content\": \"Taking a modular chain approach to offer hyper-scaled transaction throughput\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/~gitbook/ogimage/8V1H7kVgtwUQ3zzkPNbg\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:32:40 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html; charset=utf-8\",\n      \"transfer-encoding\": \"chunked\",\n      \"connection\": \"keep-alive\",\n      \"cf-cache-status\": \"DYNAMIC\",\n      \"cache-control\": \"no-cache\",\n      \"link\": \"<https://static.gitbook.com>; rel=preconnect; crossorigin=\\\"\\\"\",\n      \"strict-transport-security\": \"max-age=31536000\",\n      \"vary\": \"RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, Next-Router-Prefetch, Accept-Encoding\",\n      \"x-matched-path\": \"/middleware/[[...pathname]]\",\n      \"cf-placement\": \"remote-ORD\",\n      \"content-security-policy\": \"default-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; script-src 'self' 'nonce-Y2RiN2NjZjItYTA5NC00MWY4LTg1OTEtZDM3NmI1NGM0ZWI1' 'strict-dynamic' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://static.gitbook.com https://integrations.gitbook.com https://cdn.iframe.ly; style-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline'; img-src * 'self' blob: data: files.gitbook.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; connect-src * 'self' integrations.gitbook.com app.gitbook.com api.gitbook.com srv.buysellads.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com https://static.gitbook.com; frame-src *; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; form-action 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; frame-ancestors https: ;\",\n      \"nel\": \"{\\\"success_fraction\\\":0,\\\"report_to\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"referrer-policy\": \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\",\n      \"report-to\": \"{\\\"endpoints\\\":[{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\\\/report\\\\/v4?s=aTL1pkwyzNwnSXFlFmFi0d5cfwpy7Pi60WjHGiEldFezaGXO2jpS0My4HgNig7WdJgf05hUXQovQo8MD%2FT88GGjZXqFhe44dKrUlc0UEnD9Rf17%2BitW%2FYmLrN343OEu6Yj50NF3MtY%2F3yPdS%2BrUZ\\\"}],\\\"group\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"x-content-type-options\": \"nosniff\",\n      \"x-edge-runtime\": \"1\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache\": \"miss\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache-tag\": \"release-10.9.1072,site:site_GuZBK\",\n      \"x-gitbook-version\": \"3d1eb53\",\n      \"x-http-method\": \"GET\",\n      \"server\": \"cloudflare\",\n      \"cf-ray\": \"912811844dd69c72-IAD\",\n      \"content-encoding\": \"br\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"screenshotUrl\": null,\n  \"text\": \"Modular Blockchain | Network\\nTaking a modular chain approach to offer hyper-scaled transaction throughput\\nMantle v2 Tectonic has been released, please move to the new documentation!\\nExisting systems\\nTraditional Optimistic Rollups (ORs) rely on Ethereum for data availability, final settlement, and as an execution layer for fraud proofs.\\nTo get a clearer idea on why we built Mantle network with a modular architecture, let's talk about the standard operations of a traditional OR.\\nA typical OR can be thought of as a blockchain that processes L2 transactions on a separate execution layer, but ultimately relies on Ethereum for final settlement.

Clone the repository containing the sample scripts by executing the following command in your project directory.\\ngit clone https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-tutorial.git\\nNext, we can use yarn to download the SDK along with all the necessary dependencies, as shown below. All the dependencies are defined in the yarn.lock file, so we can just run yarn in the ./cross-dom-bridge-mnt directory.\\nWe'll need a .env file from where we can add and modify wallet and network settings. The main directory contains two .env files, where .env.local specifies the configuration for a local environment, while .env.testnet specifies the configuration to connect to testnet.\\nAll the necessary contracts addresses are already included in the respective .env files, so you can specify your preferred L1 RPC endpoint and your wallet private key to start sending transactions.\\n# testnet ENV EXEC_ENV=testnet # rpc url L1_RPC= # L1 RPC Endpoint L2_RPC=https://rpc.testnet.mantle.xyz # chain id L1_CHAINID=5 L2_CHAINID=5001 # bridge address L1_BRIDGE=0xc92470D7Ffa21473611ab6c6e2FcFB8637c8f330 L2_BRIDGE=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010 # crossDomainMessenger address L1_CDM=0x7Bfe603647d5380ED3909F6f87580D0Af1B228B4 L2_CDM=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000007 # token address L1_MNT=0xc1dC2d65A2243c22344E725677A3E3BEBD26E604 L2_MNT=0xDeadDeAddeAddEAddeadDEaDDEAdDeaDDeAD0000 L2_ETH=0xdEAddEaDdeadDEadDEADDEAddEADDEAddead1111 # local test key PRIV_KEY= # Wallet private key\\nLet's take a look at the main script.\\nAnalyzing and modifying the sample script\\nThe index.js script containing the code we need is located in the ./mantle-tutorial/cross-dom-bridge-eth directory. By default, it is configured to run on a local test environment. You can run L1 and L2 instances on your system and start deploying contracts to test your applications. You can make a copy of the index.js file before we start modifying it if you want to try that out.\\nCheck out the tutorial here that demonstrates the same bridging functionality on a private network.\\nImporting necessary libraries\\nrequire('dotenv').config() const ethers = require(\\\"ethers\\\") const mantleSDK = require(\\\"@mantleio/sdk\\\") const fs = require(\\\"fs\\\")\\nThis code does not need to be changed. We import three libraries, and the .env configuration file we created earlier.\\ndotenv : The .env file containing wallet and network configuration\\nethers : The Ethers.js library comes handy with wallet and contract operations\\n@mantlenetwork/sdk : Mantle SDK instance\\nfs: File system module to read the contract ABI from a JSON file\\nGenerating contract bytecode from ABI\\nconst L1TestERC20 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(\\\"TestERC20.json\\\"))\\nWe don't need to modify this either. The contents of the JSON file containing the contract ABI are stored in TestERC20.json which we will be using later.\\nNetwork configuration and wallet setup\\nconst l1MntAddr = process.env.L1_MNT const l2MntAddr = process.env.L2_MNT const key = process.env.PRIV_KEY const l1RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.L1_RPC) const l2RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.L2_RPC) const l1Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(key, l1RpcProvider) const l2Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(key, l2RpcProvider)\\nWe fetch the specified network and wallet configurations from the .env file, and create wallet objects by passing the private key and RPC addresses as parameters for L1 and L2.\\nCrossChainMessenger object\\n//Global variables let crossChainMessenger let l1Mnt, l2Mnt let ourAddr const setup = async () => { ourAddr = l1Wallet.address // Assigning wallet address crossChainMessenger = new mantleSDK.CrossChainMessenger({ // CrossChainMessenger object instantiation l1ChainId: process.env.L1_CHAINID, // Assigning chain IDs from .env file l2ChainId: process.env.L2_CHAINID, l1SignerOrProvider: l1Wallet, // Wallets that will sign transactions l2SignerOrProvider: l2Wallet }) l1Mnt = new ethers.Contract(l1MntAddr, L1TestERC20.abi, l1Wallet) // Contract objects l2Mnt = new ethers.Contract(l2MntAddr, L1TestERC20.abi, l2Wallet) }\\nThe CrossChainMessenger object calls the cross chain messenger contracts on L1 and L2 to transfer assets. Here we instantiate the object with chain IDs, wallet objects, and contract objects.\\nReporting balances\\nconst reportBalances = async () => { const l1Balance = (await l1Mnt.balanceOf(ourAddr)).toString().slice(0, -18) const l2Balance = (await l2Mnt.balanceOf(ourAddr)).toString().slice(0, -18) console.log(`Token on L1:${l1Balance} Token on L2:${l2Balance}`) }\\nThe reportBalances function fetches L1 and L2 wallet balances and prints them out. We'll use this method to keep track balance change after deposit and withdraw operations.\\nDeposit function\\nconst depositMNT = async () => { console.log(\\\"#################### Deposit MNT ####################\\\") await reportBalances() // 1. Print balance before deposit const start = new Date() const allowanceResponse = await crossChainMessenger.approveERC20( // 2. Approve deposit amount l1MntAddr, l2MntAddr, depositToken) await allowanceResponse.wait() console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`) const response = await crossChainMessenger.depositERC20( // 3. Send deposit transaction l1MntAddr, l2MntAddr, depositToken) console.log(`Deposit transaction hash (on L1): ${response.hash}`) // 4. Print L1 deposit transaction hash await response.wait() console.log(\\\"Waiting for status to change to RELAYED\\\") console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`) await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response.hash, mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED) await reportBalances() // 5. Print updated balance after deposit console.log(`depositERC20 took ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds\\\\n`) }\\nThe depositMNT function deposits 1 $MNT token to L2 via the Mantle bridge. The deposit transaction is sent using the depositERC20 method, which is picked up by an off-chain service and relayed to L2. The asynchronous function prints out the transaction hash and waits for the message to get relayed. Finally, we display the updated $MNT balance on L1 and L2.\\nWithdraw function\\nconst withdrawMNT = async () => { console.log(\\\"#################### Withdraw MNT ####################\\\") const start = new Date() await reportBalances() // 1. Print balance before withdraw const response = await crossChainMessenger.withdrawERC20( // 2. Send withdraw transaction l1MntAddr, l2MntAddr, withdrawToken) console.log(`Transaction hash (on L2): ${response.hash}`) // 3. Print L2 withdraw transaction hash await response.wait() console.log(\\\"Waiting for status to change to IN_CHALLENGE_PERIOD\\\") console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`) await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response.hash, // 4. Function waits for transaction to enter challenge period mantleSDK.MessageStatus.IN_CHALLENGE_PERIOD) console.log(\\\"In the challenge period, waiting for status READY_FOR_RELAY\\\") console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`) await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response.hash, mantleSDK.MessageStatus.READY_FOR_RELAY) // 5. Check whether transaction is ready for relay console.log(\\\"Ready for relay, finalizing message now\\\") console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`) await crossChainMessenger.finalizeMessage(response) console.log(\\\"Waiting for status to change to RELAYED\\\") console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`) await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response, mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED) // 6. Wait for transaction to get relayed await reportBalances() // 7. Print updated balance after withdraw console.log(`withdrawERC20 took ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n`) }\\nSimilarly, the withdrawMNT function withdraws 1 $MNT token from L2 via the Mantle bridge. The function prints out the transaction hash. The transaction then goes into a challenge period. Once it is ready for relay, it is picked up by an off-chain service to be relayed to L1. Finally, we display the updated $MNT balance on L1 and L2.\\nInvoking deposit and withdraw functions\\nconst main = async () => { await setup() await depositMNT() await withdrawMNT() } main().then(() => process.exit(0)) .catch((error) => { console.error(error) process.exit(1) })\\nWe write a main() where we call the functions to perform configuration, deposit, and withdraw operations.\\nRunning the script\\nOnce the configuration is ready, you can run the script using the yarn testnet command. The script will automatically select the testnet configuration to perform both deposit and withdraw operations in the index.js script. If you want to run the script locally, you can run yarn local.\\nConclusion\\nYou can use this code to test out the token bridging mechanism via SDK on Mantle testnet and start integrating it to your applications.\\nLast updated 11 months ago\",\n  \"markdown\": \"# Bridging $MNT using Mantle SDK\\n\\nMantle v2 Tectonic has been released, please move to the new [documentation](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/)!\\n\\nThis tutorial demonstrates how to use the Mantle SDK to deposit and withdraw $MNT tokens between Mantle and Ethereum.\\n\\n## \\n\\nSet up local environment\\n\\nMake sure you have the following tools installed in your local environment.\\n\\nLet's start by fetching the example JS scripts that we’ll work with and use to make SDK invocations from the Mantle Github. Clone the repository containing the sample scripts by executing the following command in your project directory.\\n\\n```\\ngit clone https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-tutorial.git\\n```\\n\\nNext, we can use `yarn` to download the SDK along with all the necessary dependencies, as shown below. All the dependencies are defined in the `yarn.lock` file, so we can just run `yarn` in the `./cross-dom-bridge-mnt` directory.\\n\\nWe'll need a `.env` file from where we can add and modify wallet and network settings. The main directory contains two `.env` files, where `.env.local` specifies the configuration for a local environment, while `.env.testnet` specifies the configuration to connect to testnet.\\n\\nAll the necessary contracts addresses are already included in the respective `.env` files, so you can specify your preferred L1 RPC endpoint and your wallet private key to start sending transactions.\\n\\n```\\n# testnet ENV\\nEXEC_ENV=testnet\\n# rpc url\\nL1_RPC= # L1 RPC Endpoint\\nL2_RPC=https://rpc.testnet.mantle.xyz\\n\\n# chain id\\nL1_CHAINID=5\\nL2_CHAINID=5001\\n\\n# bridge address\\nL1_BRIDGE=0xc92470D7Ffa21473611ab6c6e2FcFB8637c8f330\\nL2_BRIDGE=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010\\n\\n# crossDomainMessenger address \\nL1_CDM=0x7Bfe603647d5380ED3909F6f87580D0Af1B228B4\\nL2_CDM=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000007\\n\\n# token address\\nL1_MNT=0xc1dC2d65A2243c22344E725677A3E3BEBD26E604\\nL2_MNT=0xDeadDeAddeAddEAddeadDEaDDEAdDeaDDeAD0000\\nL2_ETH=0xdEAddEaDdeadDEadDEADDEAddEADDEAddead1111\\n\\n# local test key \\nPRIV_KEY= # Wallet private key\\n```\\n\\nLet's take a look at the main script.\\n\\n## \\n\\nAnalyzing and modifying the sample script\\n\\nThe `index.js` script containing the code we need is located in the `./mantle-tutorial/cross-dom-bridge-eth` directory. By default, it is configured to run on a local test environment. You can run L1 and L2 instances on your system and start deploying contracts to test your applications. You can make a copy of the `index.js` file before we start modifying it if you want to try that out.\\n\\n> Check out the [tutorial here](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-tutorial/tree/main/cross-dom-bridge-mnt) that demonstrates the same bridging functionality on a private network.\\n\\n### \\n\\nImporting necessary libraries\\n\\n```\\nrequire('dotenv').config()\\nconst ethers = require(\\\"ethers\\\")\\nconst mantleSDK = require(\\\"@mantleio/sdk\\\")\\nconst fs = require(\\\"fs\\\")\\n```\\n\\nThis code does not need to be changed. We import three libraries, and the `.env` configuration file we created earlier.\\n\\n*   `dotenv` : The `.env` file containing wallet and network configuration\\n    \\n*   `ethers` : The Ethers.js library comes handy with wallet and contract operations\\n    \\n*   `@mantlenetwork/sdk` : Mantle SDK instance\\n    \\n*   `fs`: File system module to read the contract ABI from a JSON file\\n    \\n\\n### \\n\\nGenerating contract bytecode from ABI\\n\\n```\\nconst L1TestERC20 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(\\\"TestERC20.json\\\"))\\n```\\n\\nWe don't need to modify this either. The contents of the JSON file containing the contract ABI are stored in `TestERC20.json` which we will be using later.\\n\\n### \\n\\nNetwork configuration and wallet setup\\n\\n```\\nconst l1MntAddr = process.env.L1_MNT\\nconst l2MntAddr = process.env.L2_MNT\\nconst key = process.env.PRIV_KEY\\n\\nconst l1RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.L1_RPC)\\nconst l2RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.L2_RPC)\\nconst l1Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(key, l1RpcProvider)\\nconst l2Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(key, l2RpcProvider)\\n```\\n\\nWe fetch the specified network and wallet configurations from the `.env` file, and create wallet objects by passing the private key and RPC addresses as parameters for L1 and L2.\\n\\n### \\n\\nCrossChainMessenger object\\n\\n```\\n//Global variables\\nlet crossChainMessenger \\nlet l1Mnt, l2Mnt\\nlet ourAddr\\n\\nconst setup = async () => {\\n  ourAddr = l1Wallet.address // Assigning wallet address\\n  crossChainMessenger = new mantleSDK.CrossChainMessenger({ // CrossChainMessenger object instantiation\\n    l1ChainId: process.env.L1_CHAINID, // Assigning chain IDs from .env file\\n    l2ChainId: process.env.L2_CHAINID,\\n    l1SignerOrProvider: l1Wallet, // Wallets that will sign transactions\\n    l2SignerOrProvider: l2Wallet\\n  })\\n  l1Mnt = new ethers.Contract(l1MntAddr, L1TestERC20.abi, l1Wallet) // Contract objects\\n  l2Mnt = new ethers.Contract(l2MntAddr, L1TestERC20.abi, l2Wallet)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe `CrossChainMessenger` object calls the cross chain messenger contracts on L1 and L2 to transfer assets. Here we instantiate the object with chain IDs, wallet objects, and contract objects.\\n\\n### \\n\\nReporting balances\\n\\n```\\nconst reportBalances = async () => {\\n  const l1Balance = (await l1Mnt.balanceOf(ourAddr)).toString().slice(0, -18)\\n  const l2Balance = (await l2Mnt.balanceOf(ourAddr)).toString().slice(0, -18)\\n  console.log(`Token on L1:${l1Balance}     Token on L2:${l2Balance}`)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe `reportBalances` function fetches L1 and L2 wallet balances and prints them out. We'll use this method to keep track balance change after deposit and withdraw operations.\\n\\n### \\n\\nDeposit function\\n\\n```\\nconst depositMNT = async () => {\\n  console.log(\\\"#################### Deposit MNT ####################\\\")\\n  await reportBalances() // 1. Print balance before deposit\\n  const start = new Date()\\n  \\n  const allowanceResponse = await crossChainMessenger.approveERC20( // 2. Approve deposit amount\\n    l1MntAddr, l2MntAddr, depositToken)\\n  await allowanceResponse.wait()\\n  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`)\\n\\n  const response = await crossChainMessenger.depositERC20( // 3. Send deposit transaction\\n    l1MntAddr, l2MntAddr, depositToken)\\n  console.log(`Deposit transaction hash (on L1): ${response.hash}`) // 4. Print L1 deposit transaction hash\\n  await response.wait()\\n  console.log(\\\"Waiting for status to change to RELAYED\\\")\\n  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`)\\n  await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response.hash, mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED)\\n\\n  await reportBalances() // 5. Print updated balance after deposit\\n  console.log(`depositERC20 took ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds\\\\n`)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe `depositMNT` function deposits 1 $MNT token to L2 via the Mantle bridge. The deposit transaction is sent using the `depositERC20` method, which is picked up by an off-chain service and relayed to L2. The asynchronous function prints out the transaction hash and waits for the message to get relayed. Finally, we display the updated $MNT balance on L1 and L2.\\n\\n### \\n\\nWithdraw function\\n\\n```\\nconst withdrawMNT = async () => {\\n  console.log(\\\"#################### Withdraw MNT ####################\\\")\\n  const start = new Date()\\n  await reportBalances() // 1. Print balance before withdraw\\n\\n  const response = await crossChainMessenger.withdrawERC20( // 2. Send withdraw transaction\\n    l1MntAddr, l2MntAddr, withdrawToken)\\n  console.log(`Transaction hash (on L2): ${response.hash}`) // 3. Print L2 withdraw transaction hash\\n  await response.wait()\\n\\n  console.log(\\\"Waiting for status to change to IN_CHALLENGE_PERIOD\\\")\\n  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`)\\n  await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response.hash, // 4. Function waits for transaction to enter challenge period\\n    mantleSDK.MessageStatus.IN_CHALLENGE_PERIOD)\\n  console.log(\\\"In the challenge period, waiting for status READY_FOR_RELAY\\\")\\n  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`)\\n  await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response.hash,\\n    mantleSDK.MessageStatus.READY_FOR_RELAY)  // 5. Check whether transaction is ready for relay \\n  console.log(\\\"Ready for relay, finalizing message now\\\")\\n  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`)\\n  await crossChainMessenger.finalizeMessage(response)\\n  console.log(\\\"Waiting for status to change to RELAYED\\\")\\n  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds`)\\n  await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response,\\n    mantleSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED)  // 6. Wait for transaction to get relayed\\n  await reportBalances() // 7. Print updated balance after withdraw\\n  console.log(`withdrawERC20 took ${(new Date() - start) / 1000} seconds\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n`)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSimilarly, the `withdrawMNT` function withdraws 1 $MNT token from L2 via the Mantle bridge. The function prints out the transaction hash. The transaction then goes into a challenge period. Once it is ready for relay, it is picked up by an off-chain service to be relayed to L1. Finally, we display the updated $MNT balance on L1 and L2.\\n\\n### \\n\\nInvoking deposit and withdraw functions\\n\\n```\\nconst main = async () => {\\n  await setup()\\n  await depositMNT()\\n  await withdrawMNT()\\n}\\n\\nmain().then(() => process.exit(0))\\n  .catch((error) => {\\n    console.error(error)\\n    process.exit(1)\\n  })\\n```\\n\\nWe write a `main()` where we call the functions to perform configuration, deposit, and withdraw operations.\\n\\n### \\n\\nRunning the script\\n\\nOnce the configuration is ready, you can run the script using the `yarn testnet` command. The script will automatically select the testnet configuration to perform both deposit and withdraw operations in the `index.js` script. If you want to run the script locally, you can run `yarn local`.\\n\\n## \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nYou can use this code to test out the token bridging mechanism via SDK on Mantle testnet and start integrating it to your applications.\\n\\nLast updated 11 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"browser\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/common-use-cases/adding-mantle-to-a-cex\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/common-use-cases/adding-mantle-to-a-cex\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:32:46.076Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network?fallback=true\",\n    \"depth\": 2\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/common-use-cases/adding-mantle-to-a-cex\",\n    \"title\": \"Adding Mantle to a CEX | Network\",\n    \"description\": null,\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"Adding Mantle to a CEX | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/~gitbook/ogimage/rzxbwMP8sPBywexHVx0N\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:32:46 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html; charset=utf-8\",\n      \"transfer-encoding\": \"chunked\",\n      \"connection\": \"keep-alive\",\n      \"cf-cache-status\": \"DYNAMIC\",\n      \"cache-control\": \"no-cache\",\n      \"link\": \"<https://static.gitbook.com>; rel=preconnect; crossorigin=\\\"\\\"\",\n      \"strict-transport-security\": \"max-age=31536000\",\n      \"vary\": \"RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, Next-Router-Prefetch, Accept-Encoding\",\n      \"x-matched-path\": \"/middleware/[[...pathname]]\",\n      \"cf-placement\": \"remote-ORD\",\n      \"content-security-policy\": \"default-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; script-src 'self' 'nonce-NWMyOTMxMjctMTRlNC00MzA1LTk2ZmEtYWFhNTJmNTc2YWEx' 'strict-dynamic' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://static.gitbook.com https://integrations.gitbook.com https://cdn.iframe.ly; style-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline'; img-src * 'self' blob: data: files.gitbook.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; connect-src * 'self' integrations.gitbook.com app.gitbook.com api.gitbook.com srv.buysellads.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com https://static.gitbook.com; frame-src *; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; form-action 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; frame-ancestors https: ;\",\n      \"nel\": \"{\\\"success_fraction\\\":0,\\\"report_to\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"referrer-policy\": \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\",\n      \"report-to\": \"{\\\"endpoints\\\":[{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\\\/report\\\\/v4?s=U3Rn8Mg3wewHKfY7ymEMQvo7WzqApJVaZwsMy7vcCKT4ofqQxU9UCumo%2FRGLXvDS0Eu0%2BjtBnipscx5E9X7NodOGykEUc8w2UIRauZqkvCDIyWbAY3fBfLvQWFTJAbUWcVXJzJQbYReYKXfcgh7l\\\"}],\\\"group\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"x-content-type-options\": \"nosniff\",\n      \"x-edge-runtime\": \"1\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache\": \"miss\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache-tag\": \"release-10.9.1072,site:site_GuZBK\",\n      \"x-gitbook-version\": \"3d1eb53\",\n      \"x-http-method\": \"GET\",\n      \"server\": \"cloudflare\",\n      \"cf-ray\": \"912811ae2aa02d06-IAD\",\n      \"content-encoding\": \"br\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"screenshotUrl\": null,\n  \"text\": \"Adding Mantle to a CEX\\nMantle v2 Tectonic has been released, please move to the new documentation!\\nConnecting to Mantle \\nMantle network shares the Ethereum JSON-RPC API with almost no differences.

For withdrawals the opposite happens, the L2 token amount is burned then the same amount of L1 tokens is transferred to the recipient. This fund can be released after the challenge period. This implementation satisfies a wide range of requirements.\\nBuilding a Custom Bridge\\nWhen the Mantle Standard bridge does not satisfy your requirements for bridging assets or data, you can deploy your custom bridge solution utilizing the same cross-domain infrastructure as the Standard bridge.

For withdrawals the opposite happens, the L2 token amount is burned then the same amount of L1 tokens is transferred to the recipient. This fund can be released after the challenge period. This implementation satisfies a wide range of requirements.\\n\\n### \\n\\n**Building a Custom Bridge**\\n\\nWhen the Mantle Standard bridge does not satisfy your requirements for bridging assets or data, you can deploy your custom bridge solution utilizing the same cross-domain infrastructure as the Standard bridge.

Hence, they’re also called assertions, since their validity hasn’t been established per se. The verification logic takes evidence of an invalid state transition to initiate the validation process, and fraud proofs are the medium to provide that. The protocol allows for a dispute window during which a network actor can come forward and submit a fraud proof disputing a state they deem to be incorrect. This challenge period is roughly 7 days for most optimistic rollup protocols. Any transaction that isn’t disputed within this time frame is assumed to be valid by default.\\nTypes of Fraud Proofs\\nFraud proofs can be classified into two distinct categories: non-interactive and interactive. Let's go over the differences in these two types of proving mechanisms.\\nNon-interactive Fraud Proofs\\nNon-interactive fraud proofs use a method where no other parties are needed to prove the incorrectness of an assertion. They basically run all the state transitions between two assertions to establish whether the resultant state is consistent or not. They are simpler to design and implement, but they place limitations on the size of assertions, since the assertions need to be small enough to run with the computational capabilities of the current EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) architecture.\\nInteractive Fraud Proofs\\nInteractive fraud proofs, on the other hand, involve two or more parties that work in tandem to verify an assertion, i.e., a party claiming a fraudulent assertion, and a party defending the said assertion. The verifier narrows down the assertion to a single state transition by interacting with the challenger, and eventually only verifies that one transition to establish its validity. This back and forth introduces a new level of complexity in the protocol, and can be harder to design safely. But it has the advantage of not placing any limitations on L1, due to a much smaller volume of actual on-chain execution.\\nImproved Fraud Proofs on Mantle Network\\nFor Mainnet Alpha, fraud proofs are currently not enabled and are currently in development. Refer to our Testnet or Github for the latest progress.\\nIn the currently popular model for fraud proofs, the contract that settles disputes — the on-chain verifier — can only execute instructions in a lower-level virtual machine such as MIPS or WASM. This forces an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) client to re-compile their fraud proof into the lower-level language to be interpretable to the on-chain verifier. This means that the content of a fraud proof is generated outside the scope of the EVM. \\nThe implication here is that because of the low-level transpiling, there is no way to guarantee that a fraud proof's contents are derived directly from a compliant EVM client. In other words, the on-chain verifier is blind to the producer of the fraud proof! This blind spot interferes with the trust-minimization that is imbued into the Ethereum client to begin with. It would be far better for a fraud proof to be evaluated using EVM instructions directly. \\nThis is precisely the sort of system that Mantle network implements. Mantle network establishes transaction validity using the interactive fraud proof mechanism, and by compiling and verifying fraud proofs with EVM-level instructions we register a number of benefits:\\nAllow all Ethereum clients to interact with a common proof system, permissionlessly.\\nReduce trust assumptions across verifiers, clients, and compilers.\\nThe particular fraud proof model that is employed by Mantle network (testnet) is akin to the one deployed by Specular Network.

The Initiation\\nA wallet user, a dApp, or a script somewhere wants to use a blockchain based system to transfer funds, or perform a task. \\nIn the case of the user, they've already connected to the Mantle network by adding the RPC endpoint of a Sequencer node to their wallet. \\nThe dApp on the other hand has integrated the Mantle SDK and has already instantiated it to be able to talk to the Mantle network. They are both ready to send a request that contains a receiver's address and the amount they want to transfer.\\nJust like any service, this action requires a fee.

As Mantle network is a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain, there are new paradigms in the fee structure that cause it to differ from Ethereum's fee. \\nSince Mantle Network is constantly perfecting EVM compatibility, dApps can conveniently handle any changes with minor modifications. Let's take a look at the two sources of transaction costs on Mantle.\\nThe L2 transaction fee for Layer-2 execution\\nThe L1 rollup fee to cover the cost of publishing rollup state roots to L1 (divided equally among users whose transactions were included in the rollup batch)\\nThe estimateGas API currently only returns L2 gas cost. The L1 gas estimate needs to be calculated separately. We will support fetching the total L1+L2 gas estimate through the estimateGas interface in a future network update.\\nThe L2 Transaction Fee\\nJust like Ethereum, transactions on Mantle network have to pay gas for the amount of computation and storage that they use. Every L2 transaction will pay some execution fee, equal to the amount of gas used by the transaction multiplied by the gas price attached to the transaction.\\nHere's the (simple) math:\\nL2ExecutionFee = L2GasPrice * L2GasUsed\\nThe amount of L2 gas used depends on the particular transaction that you're trying to send. Thanks to EVM compatibility, transactions typically use approximately the same amount of gas on Mantle Network as they do on Ethereum. Gas prices fluctuate with time and congestion, but you can always check the current estimated L2 gas price on the public Mantle dashboard. Also, since gas fees on L2 Mantle Network are charged in $MNT, it means at the same gas price the transaction cost incurred will still be significantly lower than other L2 networks that use $ETH as the gas token.\\nThe L1 Rollup Fee\\nAll the state roots that are generated on L2 as result of transaction execution are published to Ethereum. This step is crucial to the security properties of Mantle because it means that all of the most up-to-date block data from L2 Mantle Network that you need to sync a node is always publicly available on L1 Ethereum.\\nWith the EigenDA-powered Mantle DA module online with Mantle Mainnet, only state roots and a limited amount of necessary transaction data are sent to L1, while the transaction batch data is posted to the DA network. For dApps with high gas consumption, they can be executed at the same cost as an ordinary transaction (like a transfer), and the L1 fee will not increase with the complexity of L2 transaction execution. As a result, for transactions with high complexity, this can even save upto ～70% of the cost compared to the original L1 rollup fee.\\nMantle publishes rollup states and some necessary transaction data to Ethereum by packaging transactions into batches, and the amount of $ETH spent during this process will be divided among the users whose transactions were included in the batch. The cost-per-user is significantly cheaper than it would be if the transactions were executed on L1. The L1 rollup fee is calculated from the following sub-factors:\\nThe current gas price on Ethereum.\\nA fixed overhead (auto-adjusted and set into gas oracle)\\nThe scaling factor (currently set to 1)\\nThe $ETH to $MNT conversion ratio\\nHere's the math:\\nL1RollupFee = L1GasPrice * Overhead * Ratio\\nThe transaction fees incurred by users is calculated and deducted as described below:\\nA connection is made to the RPC and the EstimateGas method is called to calculate the gas cost on L2 (if you use a wallet, such as MetaMask, this step will be executed automatically). This is the L2 Transaction Fee.\\nA transaction is signed and submitted\\nMantle node receives the transaction and checks if the account balance is sufficient, including the L2 Transaction Fee and L1 Rollup Fee*.\\nThe transaction is executed successfully, recording your interaction with Mantle Network.\\n*Note that there is currently no RPC interface that provides accurate estimates of L1 Rollup Fee, please ensure that wallets have sufficient balance, even though the amount needed is generally very small.\\nKeep in Mind\\nSending Transactions \\nSince Mantle supports Ethereum's JSON RPC interface, you can use the eth_gasPrice method to obtain recommended L2 gas price values. Similarly, you can use eth_estimateGas to estimate your L2 gas usage.\\nGas Price Updates\\nGas prices on L2 are set to 0.05 Gwei by default, it will be updated every once in a while with reference to the recent blocks on Ethereum.\\nEIP-1559 Support\\nCurrently, Mantle Network does NOT support EIP-1559, so we recommend using legacy structuring for your transactions. The order of transactions is FIFO, and it will be executed based on the sequence (time of receiving) they are received in.\\nDisplaying Fees to Users\\nYou can use the RPC method eth_getTransactionReceipt to obtain the fees for a particular transaction, where the L1 Rollup Fee portion is listed as the field l1fee.\\nEstimating the Total Fee \\nYou can estimate the total fee by combining your estimates for the L2 execution fee and L1 data fee.\\nCommon RPC Errors\\nInsufficient Funds\\nError code: -32000\\nError message: invalid transaction: insufficient funds for l1Fee + l2Fee + value \\nYou'll get this error when the account's $MNT balance is not enough to cover the transaction fee and the transfer amount. Check the account balance to ensure that the minimum amount requirements are met.\\nGas Price Too Low\\nError code: -32000 \\nError message: gas price too low: X wei, use at least tx.gasPrice = Y wei \\nThis is a custom RPC error that Mantle network returns when a transaction is rejected because the set gas price is too low. Currently, at least 0.05 Gwei is required, which can be obtained from the GasOracle contract 0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F\\nGas Price Too High\\nError code: -32000 \\nError message: gas price too high: X wei, use at most tx.gasPrice = Y wei \\nThis is a custom RPC error that Mantle network returns when a transaction is rejected because the set gas price is too high.

The transaction is executed successfully, recording your interaction with Mantle Network.\\n    \\n\\n_\\\\*Note that there is currently no RPC interface that provides accurate estimates of L1 Rollup Fee, please ensure that wallets have sufficient balance, even though the amount needed is generally very small._\\n\\n## \\n\\nKeep in Mind\\n\\n### \\n\\n**Sending Transactions**\\n\\nSince Mantle supports Ethereum's JSON RPC interface, you can use the `eth_gasPrice` method to obtain recommended L2 gas price values. Similarly, you can use `eth_estimateGas` to estimate your L2 gas usage.\\n\\n### \\n\\n**Gas Price Updates**\\n\\nGas prices on L2 are set to **0.05 Gwei** by default, it will be updated every once in a while with reference to the recent blocks on Ethereum.\\n\\n### \\n\\nEIP-1559 Support\\n\\nCurrently, Mantle Network does **NOT** support EIP-1559, so we recommend using legacy structuring for your transactions. The order of transactions is FIFO, and it will be executed based on the sequence (time of receiving) they are received in.\\n\\n### \\n\\n**Displaying Fees to Users**\\n\\nYou can use the RPC method `eth_getTransactionReceipt` to obtain the fees for a particular transaction, where the L1 Rollup Fee portion is listed as the field `l1fee`.\\n\\n#### \\n\\n**Estimating the Total Fee**\\n\\nYou can estimate the total fee by combining your estimates for the L2 execution fee and L1 data fee.\\n\\n## \\n\\nCommon RPC Errors\\n\\n### \\n\\nInsufficient Funds\\n\\n**Error code:** -32000\\n\\n**Error message:** invalid transaction: insufficient funds for l1Fee + l2Fee + value\\n\\nYou'll get this error when the account's $MNT balance is not enough to cover the transaction fee and the transfer amount. Check the account balance to ensure that the minimum amount requirements are met.\\n\\n### \\n\\nGas Price Too Low\\n\\n**Error code:** -32000\\n\\n**Error message:** gas price too low: X wei, use at least tx.gasPrice = Y wei\\n\\nThis is a custom RPC error that Mantle network returns when a transaction is rejected because the set gas price is too low. Currently, at least **0.05 Gwei** is required, which can be obtained from the `GasOracle` contract `0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F`\\n\\n### \\n\\nGas Price Too High\\n\\nError code: -32000\\n\\nError message: gas price too high: X wei, use at most tx.gasPrice = Y wei\\n\\nThis is a custom RPC error that Mantle network returns when a transaction is rejected because the set gas price is too high. Currently limit is set at **200 Gwei.**\\n\\nLast updated 11 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/resources-and-tooling/mantle-node-api\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/resources-and-tooling/mantle-node-api\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:32:51.758Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network?fallback=true\",\n    \"depth\": 2\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/resources-and-tooling/mantle-node-api\",\n    \"title\": \"Mantle Node API | Network\",\n    \"description\": \"RPC API Reference\",\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"Mantle Node API | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:description\",\n        \"content\": \"RPC API Reference\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/~gitbook/ogimage/JkNThJJrsyCURf0dpPcy\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:32:51 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html; charset=utf-8\",\n      \"transfer-encoding\": \"chunked\",\n      \"connection\": \"keep-alive\",\n      \"cf-cache-status\": \"DYNAMIC\",\n      \"cache-control\": \"no-cache\",\n      \"link\": \"<https://static.gitbook.com>; rel=preconnect; crossorigin=\\\"\\\"\",\n      \"strict-transport-security\": \"max-age=31536000\",\n      \"vary\": \"RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, Next-Router-Prefetch, Accept-Encoding\",\n      \"x-matched-path\": \"/middleware/[[...pathname]]\",\n      \"cf-placement\": \"remote-ORD\",\n      \"content-security-policy\": \"default-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; script-src 'self' 'nonce-NWM4MDIzM2ItMDM5NS00YjIzLWFhZGItYWVmNDdkMWVmOTNi' 'strict-dynamic' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://static.gitbook.com https://integrations.gitbook.com https://cdn.iframe.ly; style-src 'self' https://static.gitbook.com fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline'; img-src * 'self' blob: data: files.gitbook.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; connect-src * 'self' integrations.gitbook.com app.gitbook.com api.gitbook.com srv.buysellads.com https://static.gitbook.com https://ka-p.fontawesome.com; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com https://static.gitbook.com; frame-src *; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; form-action 'self' https://static.gitbook.com; frame-ancestors https: ;\",\n      \"nel\": \"{\\\"success_fraction\\\":0,\\\"report_to\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"referrer-policy\": \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\",\n      \"report-to\": \"{\\\"endpoints\\\":[{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/a.nel.cloudflare.com\\\\/report\\\\/v4?s=sJPrfeBEbH27Aro6p8%2BfYDHEHQruelokQt5CD1qyhmHW6ex%2FvizLNj96oasKKOs%2BHj9OWByBFCBZmlcozOUhwDWlfvTK8GbE7kpPpINAwhSrQVSMnKpuGWIQtYsFi%2FoxCOIB%2BU7zjxN6UC47K4hp\\\"}],\\\"group\\\":\\\"cf-nel\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":604800}\",\n      \"x-content-type-options\": \"nosniff\",\n      \"x-edge-runtime\": \"1\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache\": \"miss\",\n      \"x-gitbook-cache-tag\": \"release-10.9.1072,site:site_GuZBK\",\n      \"x-gitbook-version\": \"3d1eb53\",\n      \"x-http-method\": \"GET\",\n      \"server\": \"cloudflare\",\n      \"cf-ray\": \"912811ce9ae53b66-IAD\",\n      \"content-encoding\": \"br\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"screenshotUrl\": null,\n  \"text\": \"Mantle Node API | Network\\nMantle v2 Tectonic has been released, please move to the new documentation!\\nApplications need to connect to a node to fetch block data and send transactions to the Mantle network.

What signature algorithm does Mantle Network use?\\nMantle Network uses the same signature algorithm as Ethereum. (ECDSA on the secp256k1 curve)\\nQ. What is the block gas limit on Mantle Network?\\nThe block gas limit is currently set to 30,000,000, or 30M units.\\nQ. What's the average block time on Mantle Network?\\nNew blocks are generated on L2 every time a new transaction is received, and each block contains a single transaction. Thus, the block time on Mantle Network depends on the transaction volume at any given time.\\nQ. How does transaction finality work on Mantle Network?\\nTransaction/block finality on L2 is instantaneous\\nTransaction/block finality on L1 connects to the challenge period, which is currently set at 7 days \\nQ. Are fraud proofs online on Mantle Network?\\nAs of mainnet alpha release, fraud proofs are in development. For more details on Mantle Network's implementation, check out the page on Fraud Proofs\\nQ. How does modular data availability bring down transaction costs?\\nThe majority of L2 gas costs (>70%) are incurred as the cost to publish data on L1 Ethereum. With Mantle DA powered by EigenDA technology, only state root data (along with very limited transaction data) is posted to L1 contracts, while the rollup data is posted to Mantle DA, which helps bring down the overall cost significantly.\\nQ. Can I fetch DA transaction details with an API?\\nCurrently, the only way see DA transaction history is via the Explorer frontend. Here's the link: https://explorer.mantle.xyz/eigenda-batches\\nQ. Where can I find the brand resources for Mantle Network?\\nYou can access brand resources by following this link.\\nProtocol\\nQ. Do Rollup Verifier nodes verify every piece of block data processed by the Sequencer?\\nYes. All updated state roots are verified by Rollup Verifiers before they are submitted to L1 as a part of the rollup process.\\nQ. Do Rollup Verifiers sync rollup data from the Sequencer?\\nNo. Rollup Verifiers sync rollup data from Mantle DA, which they use to generate state roots and verify the updated state roots generated by the Sequencer before they are published to L1. \\nQ. Before fraud proofs are online on Mantle Network, what happens if a Rollup Verifier detects that L2 block data doesn't match with the data being submitted to L1?\\nIf Rollup Verifiers detect a discrepancy when verifying the updated state roots, the rollup mechanism on L2 is temporarily halted.

I noticed unknown gas fee being deducted from my wallet when sending transactions. Why is that?\\nOur gas oracle API currently only supports fetching L2 gas fee. The extra fee being deducted is the L1 rollup fee. This will be fixed soon in a future update!\\nQ. Why does my transaction fail when I try to send a transaction with the \\\"Max\\\" amount from my wallet?\\nA transaction sent with the \\\"Max\\\" amount fails with an error stating that the transaction is underpriced because our gas oracle currently only supports fetching L2 gas fee estimation, which is why the wallet undercalculates the actual gas fee that needs to paid since it is not including the L1 rollup fee. This issue will be addressed with a future network update. In the meantime, we recommend leaving at least 0.5 $MNT in your wallet to pay for L1 rollup fees. \\nFor example, if you have 10 $MNT in your wallet, please limit the transaction amount to a maximum of 9.5 $MNT for a single transaction.\\nQ. Are there any limits set for batch transaction size?\\nThe maximum batch transaction size is derived from the target gas configuration. Mantle Network is the same as Ethereum in this regard.\\nQ. Are there any limits on the gas price that can be paid when sending transactions on Mantle Network?\\nCurrently, the gas range has been set to 0.05 - 200 Gwei in order to protect users from overpaying gas fees. This limit is active on Mantle Mainnet, and will soon be applied to testnet as well.\\nQ. Does Mantle Network support EIP-1559?\\nCurrently, Mantle Network does NOT support EIP-1559, so we recommend using legacy structuring for your transactions. The order of transactions is FIFO, and it will be executed based on the sequence (time of receiving) they are received in.\\nQ. Does Mantle Network support transactions that aren't signed with the chain ID?\\nNo, Mantle Network does not support pre-EIP155 transactions that aren't signed with the chain ID.\\nExplorer\\nQ. Does the RPC rate limit affect Explorer API usage too?\\nYes. Once the RPC rate limit is reached, access to Explorer API will also be limited.\\nNode operators\\nQ.

Does Mantle Network support EIP-1559?\\n\\nCurrently, Mantle Network does **NOT** support EIP-1559, so we recommend using legacy structuring for your transactions. The order of transactions is FIFO, and it will be executed based on the sequence (time of receiving) they are received in.\\n\\n### \\n\\nQ. Does Mantle Network support transactions that aren't signed with the chain ID?\\n\\nNo, Mantle Network does not support pre-[EIP155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md) transactions that aren't signed with the chain ID.\\n\\n## \\n\\nExplorer\\n\\n### \\n\\nQ. Does the RPC rate limit affect Explorer API usage too?\\n\\nYes. Once the RPC rate limit is reached, access to Explorer API will also be limited.\\n\\n## \\n\\nNode operators\\n\\n### \\n\\nQ. How big is the current testnet state?\\n\\nYou can find details on this subject here:\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/how-to-guides/connecting-wallet-to-mantle-network\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/how-to-guides/connecting-wallet-to-mantle-network\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:32:55.379Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network?fallback=true\",\n    \"depth\": 2\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/how-to-guides/connecting-wallet-to-mantle-network\",\n    \"title\": \"Connecting Wallet to Mantle Network | Network\",\n    \"description\": \"Adding Mantle Network configuration and the $MNT token to your wallet\",\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"Connecting Wallet to Mantle Network | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:description\",\n        \"content\": \"Adding Mantle Network configuration and the $MNT token to your wallet\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/~gitbook/ogimage/8SJzFIqbxB556MIDhtqf\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:32:55 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html;

These signatures are verified by an EigenDA contract on Ethereum\\nMantle DA powered by EigenDA technology consists of a set of supported interactions between four major components as described below.\\nOperators\\nThe service providers of the DA network and need to confirm their commitment through digital signatures, which place staked assets as a collateral guarantee on their participation. An Operator carries out the following tasks:\\nRun nodes which store chunks of data for a pre-defined time period and serve these chunks upon request\\nDispersers\\nThey're the users of Mantle DA's data availability service, paying for its economic guarantees of data availability. This role may be played by a rollup Sequencer. A Disperser performs the following tasks:\\nEncodes its data into chunks, posts funds for making the data available for a fixed amount of time, and distributes the encoded chunks to Mantle DA operators\\nAggregates signatures from the operators and posts an attestation to the blockchain, confirming availability of the data of interest for the specified time period\\nChallengers\\nThey're interested parties who play an important role in the Proof of Custody protocol. Challengers perform the following tasks:\\nMonitor certain verifiable operations of the protocol (which in the optimistic case are not verified or resolved on-chain) \\nPermissionlessly force problematic operations to be resolved on-chain, resulting in an operator’s stake being slashed\\nThe Proof of Custody protocol is in development stage and will go online with a future Mainnet upgrade.\\nMantleLayer and MantleDA Smart Contracts\\nThe collection of DA-related smart contracts running on Ethereum take care of the following:\\nEnsure that data is only accepted as available when a group of operators having a sufficient amount of stake has collectively signed\\nImplement the proof-of-custody protocol and provide mechanisms for a challenger to disclose data on chain\\nVerify the validity of data submitted by Challengers against a signed commitment, and enact slashing as dictated by the proof-of-custody protocol\\nThe data storage process on Mantle DA is as follows:\\nEncoding: Disperser encodes data chunks and generates KZG multireveal proofs which will allow Operators to verify the correctness of their chunk.\\nDispersal: Disperser sends data chunks to respective DA Operators\\nAttestation: Operators verify their chunks against the global commitment. If the verification is successful, the Operator proceeds to store their chunk of data for the duration specified by the Disperser and sends back an attestation\\nAggregation: If enough signatures are received, the Disperser aggregates the signatures and publishes them to L1 Ethereum.\\nWhy Run a Rollup Verifier Node?\\nThere are multiple advantages of running a Rollup Verifier node.\\nIt grants many of the benefits of running an Ethereum node, such as the ability to simulate L2 transactions locally without rate-limiting (public RPCs may face such limitations).\\nAllows anyone to verify the work performed by Sequencers by re-deriving output roots and comparing them against those submitted by the Sequencer. In case of a mismatch, verifiers will be able to perform a fault check and claim rewards by submitting fraud proofs on future versions of Mainnet.\\ndApp builders are encouraged to consider the value addition of running a Rollup Verifier node given that the overhead costs tend to be low.\\nThe diagram below illustrates how the Sequencer and Rollup Verifier fit together.

The state roots **MUST** be signed by a TSS node before they are sent to Ethereum to be recorded.\\n\\nDuring the initial phases of release, TSS nodes are run by a group of reputable institutions, but will eventually be voted in via Mantle governance permissionlessly.\\n\\n### \\n\\nRollup Verifiers / Replica Nodes\\n\\n*   Sync rollup data from Mantle's trusted sequencer\\n    \\n*   Verify the state roots submitted by Sequencers on L2\\n    \\n*   Initiate fraud proofs when invalid state data is found\\n    \\n*   Serve rollup data to users\\n    \\n\\nFraud proofs are a part of our [roadmap](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/architecture-and-roadmap#roadmap) and the feature will be added eventually via a Mainnet upgrade.\\n\\n### \\n\\nDA Nodes\\n\\n*   Opt into taking the responsibility of storing a copy of Mantle transaction data to have it ready for access whenever necessary\\n    \\n*   Make a commitment by signing the block data they provide using the [BLS signature scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature) guaranteeing its usability. These signatures are verified by an EigenDA contract on Ethereum\\n    \\n\\nMantle DA powered by EigenDA technology consists of a set of supported interactions between four major components as described below.\\n\\n![](https://docs.mantle.xyz/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3701411312-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FNHXgeqhgrznnRobzznxl%252Fuploads%252FAsnGr1cXLy9Og1JIVxE8%252Fupdated%2520da%2520interaction.jpg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D1718a0e4-4941-4255-a886-c8c5af2fdfef&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=4935a0e1&sv=2)\\n\\n#### \\n\\nOperators\\n\\nThe service providers of the DA network and need to confirm their commitment through digital signatures, which place staked assets as a collateral guarantee on their participation. An Operator carries out the following tasks:\\n\\n*   Run nodes which store chunks of data for a pre-defined time period and serve these chunks upon request\\n    \\n\\n#### \\n\\nDispersers\\n\\nThey're the users of Mantle DA's data availability service, paying for its economic guarantees of data availability. This role may be played by a rollup [Sequencer](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-validators/network-roles#sequencers). A Disperser performs the following tasks:\\n\\n*   Encodes its data into chunks, posts funds for making the data available for a fixed amount of time, and distributes the encoded chunks to Mantle DA operators\\n    \\n*   Aggregates signatures from the operators and posts an attestation to the blockchain, confirming availability of the data of interest for the specified time period\\n    \\n\\n#### \\n\\nChallengers\\n\\nThey're interested parties who play an important role in the Proof of Custody protocol. Challengers perform the following tasks:\\n\\n*   Monitor certain verifiable operations of the protocol (which in the optimistic case are not verified or resolved on-chain)\\n    \\n*   Permissionlessly force problematic operations to be resolved on-chain, resulting in an operator’s stake being slashed\\n    \\n\\nThe Proof of Custody protocol is in development stage and will go online with a future Mainnet upgrade.\\n\\n#### \\n\\n`MantleLayer` and `MantleDA` Smart Contracts\\n\\nThe collection of DA-related smart contracts running on Ethereum take care of the following:\\n\\n*   Ensure that data is only accepted as available when a group of operators having a sufficient amount of stake has collectively signed\\n    \\n*   Implement the proof-of-custody protocol and provide mechanisms for a challenger to disclose data on chain\\n    \\n*   Verify the validity of data submitted by Challengers against a signed commitment, and enact slashing as dictated by the proof-of-custody protocol\\n    \\n\\nThe data storage process on Mantle DA is as follows:\\n\\n1.  Encoding: Disperser encodes data chunks and generates KZG multireveal proofs which will allow Operators to verify the correctness of their chunk.\\n    \\n2.  Dispersal: Disperser sends data chunks to respective DA Operators\\n    \\n3.  Attestation: Operators verify their chunks against the global commitment. If the verification is successful, the Operator proceeds to store their chunk of data for the duration specified by the Disperser and sends back an attestation\\n    \\n4.  Aggregation: If enough signatures are received, the Disperser aggregates the signatures and publishes them to L1 Ethereum.\\n    \\n\\n## \\n\\n**Why Run a Rollup Verifier Node?**\\n\\nThere are multiple advantages of running a Rollup Verifier node.\\n\\n1.  It grants many of the benefits of running an Ethereum node, such as the ability to simulate L2 transactions locally **without rate-limiting** (public RPCs may face such limitations)**.**\\n    \\n2.  Allows anyone to verify the work performed by Sequencers by **re-deriving output roots** and **comparing** them against those submitted by the Sequencer. In case of a mismatch, verifiers will be able to perform a fault check and claim rewards by submitting fraud proofs on future versions of Mainnet.\\n    \\n\\n**dApp builders** are encouraged to consider the value addition of running a Rollup Verifier node given that the overhead costs tend to be low.\\n\\nThe diagram below illustrates how the Sequencer and Rollup Verifier fit together. Note that actions in red are performed by a **Sequencer**, while actions in blue are performed by a **Rollup Verifier**:\\n\\nLast updated 11 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/resources-and-tooling/covalent-data-indexing-api\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/resources-and-tooling/covalent-data-indexing-api\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:32:57.863Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network?fallback=true\",\n    \"depth\": 2\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/resources-and-tooling/covalent-data-indexing-api\",\n    \"title\": \"Covalent Data Indexing API | Network\",\n    \"description\": null,\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languageCode\": \"en\",\n    \"openGraph\": [\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:title\",\n        \"content\": \"Covalent Data Indexing API | Network\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"property\": \"og:image\",\n        \"content\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/~gitbook/ogimage/wZPzcTKJKBHAnj65yr7c\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"jsonLd\": null,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"date\": \"Sat, 15 Feb 2025 20:32:57 GMT\",\n      \"content-type\": \"text/html;

It can manage dependencies, compile your project, run tests, deploy contracts, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line and via Solidity scripts.Foundry comes with the following tools that can be used to debugging:\\nAnvil: Used to deploy a local Ethereum node\\nCast: Used to send RPC calls and interact with the chain\\nForge: Used to build, compile, and test smart contracts\\nYou can install Foundry by running the following commands:\\nLinux/Mac:\\ncurl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash foundryup\\nWindows: (Requires Rust, install from https://rustup.rs/)\\ncargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry --bins --locked\\nDocker:\\ndocker pull ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest\\nAnvil\\nAnvil deploys a local Ethereum node in your environment that can be used to deploy a node. Simply run anvil to deploy one. \\nIt has a few useful properties. It allows you to fork a network at the latest, or any specific height. You can run the following command to fork the Mantle mainnet environment for debugging your code:\\nexport RPC_URL=\\\"https://rpc.mantle.xyz\\\" anvil --fork-url $RPC_URL\\nCall traces are more detailed, i.e., we can see which functions are being executed in remote contracts, i.e., the functions that executed by every contract.\\nNote that it isn't necessary to use an Anvil node to use Foundry. You can use other local nodes like Hardhat, Ganache, etc. as well.\\nCast\\nYou can use the following cast commands to interact with the chain.\\nThe examples below are based on Anvil. If you have Anvil up and running, try invoking the following cases in another command line window. This will allow you to debug online contracts using the mantle mainnet.\\ncast call / cast send\\ncast send can be used to sign and publish a transaction on the chain.You can use it make an arbitrary contract method call, like so:\\ncast send $contract_address \\\"someFunc(unit256)\\\" 0x... \\\\--private-key $wallet_private_key\\ncast call on the other hand can be used to perform an account call without publishing it to the chain, and that's why you don't need to specify a private key.So for instance, you can make a contract method call, like so:\\ncast call $contract_address \\\"someFunc(uint, args[])\\\" $number \\\"[arg_1, ... , arg_n]\\\"\\nexport WMNT=0x78c1b0C915c4FAA5FffA6CAbf0219DA63d7f4cb8 cast call $WMNT \\\"balanceOf(address)\\\" 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f //0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000006cfd1854e3ec57a5d636d cast --to-dec 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000006cfd1854e3ec57a5d636d //8234949754837270014026605\\ncast run\\ncast run can be used to run a published transaction in a local environment and print the trace. For example:\\ncast run $TX_HASH\\ncast run 0xf500a3c8e08960aa28ccdd557730087b1d9b618a42b9595c7800ceeff53dddaa\\nYou can also replay transactions in the debugger using the --debug flag, like so:\\ncast run --debug $TX_HASH\\nTaking this deposit transaction as an example:\\ncast run 0x16a3d14f54fc36097184b2b774b0d30e35e03e033805eb3180a0ee8d4c5427ef --debug\\nLearn more about the debugger interface here: https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/debugger\\ncast block / cast tx\\ncast block can be used to fetch block information from the chain. Running cast block returns block info for the latest block.\\ncast tx can be used to fetch transaction information from the chain using the transaction hash. The command structure is as follows:\\ncast tx $TX_HASH\\ncast rpc\\ncast rpc can be used to send a raw JSON-RPC request to a node.Since Mantle Network supports Ethereum's JSON-RPC interface, you can use the following command to call eth_getBlockByNumber and fetch information for the latest block:\\ncast rpc --rpc-url https://rpc.mantle.xyz/ eth_getBlockByNumber \\\"latest\\\" \\\"false\\\"\\ncast storage & cast index\\ncast storage can be used to fetch the raw value of a contract's storage slot. cast-index can compute the storage slot location for an entry in a mapping.The cast index calculates the storage location based on the KEY_TYPE, KEY, and SLOT_NUMBER.For example, to fetch the value of slot 0 for a contract:\\ncast storage $contract_address 0\\nWe'll take the balance of account 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f about $WMNT as an example, which can be obtained in two ways:\\nConventional function call method This has already been implemented in the aforementioned cast call.\\nReading contract slot storage method First, based on the WMNT source code, it's determined that the balanceOf state variable is located at the 0th slot with KEY_TYPE being 'address'.\\ncontract WMANTLE is ERC20 { constructor() ERC20(\\\"Wrapped Mantle\\\", \\\"WMNT\\\") {} event Deposit(address indexed dst, uint256 wad); event Withdrawal(address indexed src, uint256 wad); ... contract ERC20 is Context, IERC20, IERC20Metadata { mapping(address => uint256) private _balances; mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) private _allowances; uint256 private _totalSupply; string private _name; string private _symbol; ...\\n＃ For KEY 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f and slot 0, the corresponding storage location. cast index address 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f 0 //0x2edcadc9f197c279f92ccdbf8b108a59937d545e881935fccd2cb58923bc739b ＃ Retrieve the raw data from the corresponding storage location, converting from address to integer, address=>int cast storage $WMNT 0x2edcadc9f197c279f92ccdbf8b108a59937d545e881935fccd2cb58923bc739b 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000006cfd1854e3ec57a5d636d\\ncast abi-decode / cast abi-encode\\ncast abi-decode can be used to decode any ABI-encoded data. For example, to decode the output data for a balanceOf call:\\ncast abi-decode \\\"balanceOf(address)(uint256)\\\" \\\\0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a\\ncast abi-encode can be used to ABI encode any given function arguments, excluding the selector.

It can manage dependencies, compile your project, run tests, deploy contracts, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line and via Solidity scripts.Foundry comes with the following tools that can be used to debugging:\\n\\n*   Anvil: Used to deploy a local Ethereum node\\n    \\n*   Cast: Used to send RPC calls and interact with the chain\\n    \\n*   Forge: Used to build, compile, and test smart contracts\\n    \\n\\nYou can install Foundry by running the following commands:\\n\\n**Linux/Mac**:\\n\\n```\\ncurl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash\\nfoundryup\\n```\\n\\n**Windows**: (Requires Rust, install from [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/))\\n\\n```\\ncargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry --bins --locked\\n```\\n\\n**Docker**:\\n\\n```\\ndocker pull ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest\\n```\\n\\n#### \\n\\nAnvil\\n\\nAnvil deploys a local Ethereum node in your environment that can be used to deploy a node. Simply run anvil to deploy one.\\n\\nIt has a few useful properties. It allows you to fork a network at the latest, or any specific height. You can run the following command to fork the Mantle mainnet environment for debugging your code:\\n\\n```\\nexport RPC_URL=\\\"https://rpc.mantle.xyz\\\"\\nanvil --fork-url $RPC_URL\\n```\\n\\nCall traces are more detailed, i.e., we can see which functions are being executed in remote contracts, i.e., the functions that executed by every contract.\\n\\nNote that it isn't necessary to use an Anvil node to use Foundry. You can use other local nodes like Hardhat, Ganache, etc. as well.\\n\\n#### \\n\\nCast\\n\\nYou can use the following cast commands to interact with the chain.\\n\\nThe examples below are based on Anvil. If you have Anvil up and running, try invoking the following cases in another command line window. This will allow you to debug online contracts using the mantle mainnet.\\n\\n**cast call / cast send**\\n\\n[cast send](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-send) can be used to sign and publish a transaction on the chain.You can use it make an arbitrary contract method call, like so:\\n\\n> cast send $contract\\\\_address \\\"someFunc(unit256)\\\" 0x... \\\\\\\\--private-key $wallet\\\\_private\\\\_key\\n\\n[cast call](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-call) on the other hand can be used to perform an account call without publishing it to the chain, and that's why you don't need to specify a private key.So for instance, you can make a contract method call, like so:\\n\\n> cast call $contract\\\\_address \\\"someFunc(uint, args\\\\[\\\\])\\\" $number \\\"\\\\[arg\\\\_1, ... , arg\\\\_n\\\\]\\\"\\n\\n```\\nexport WMNT=0x78c1b0C915c4FAA5FffA6CAbf0219DA63d7f4cb8\\ncast call $WMNT \\\"balanceOf(address)\\\" 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f\\n//0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000006cfd1854e3ec57a5d636d\\ncast --to-dec 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000006cfd1854e3ec57a5d636d\\n//8234949754837270014026605\\n```\\n\\n**cast run**\\n\\n[cast run](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-run) can be used to run a published transaction in a local environment and print the trace. For example:\\n\\n> cast run $TX\\\\_HASH\\n\\n```\\ncast run 0xf500a3c8e08960aa28ccdd557730087b1d9b618a42b9595c7800ceeff53dddaa\\n```\\n\\nYou can also replay transactions in the debugger using the `--debug` flag, like so:\\n\\n> cast run --debug $TX\\\\_HASH\\n\\nTaking this deposit transaction as an example:\\n\\n```\\ncast run 0x16a3d14f54fc36097184b2b774b0d30e35e03e033805eb3180a0ee8d4c5427ef --debug\\n```\\n\\nLearn more about the debugger interface here: [https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/debugger](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/debugger)\\n\\n**cast block / cast tx**\\n\\n[`cast block`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-block) can be used to fetch block information from the chain. Running `cast block` returns block info for the latest block.\\n\\n[`cast tx`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-tx) can be used to fetch transaction information from the chain using the transaction hash. The command structure is as follows:\\n\\n> cast tx $TX\\\\_HASH\\n\\n**cast rpc**\\n\\n[`cast rpc`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-rpc) can be used to send a raw JSON-RPC request to a node.Since Mantle Network supports Ethereum's JSON-RPC interface, you can use the following command to call `eth_getBlockByNumber` and fetch information for the latest block:\\n\\n> cast rpc --rpc-url https://rpc.mantle.xyz/ eth\\\\_getBlockByNumber \\\"latest\\\" \\\"false\\\"\\n\\n#### \\n\\ncast storage & cast index\\n\\n[`cast storage`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-storage) can be used to fetch the raw value of a contract's storage slot. cast-index can compute the storage slot location for an entry in a mapping.The cast index calculates the storage location based on the KEY\\\\_TYPE, KEY, and SLOT\\\\_NUMBER.For example, to fetch the value of slot 0 for a contract:\\n\\n> cast storage $contract\\\\_address 0\\n\\nWe'll take the balance of account 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f about $WMNT as an example, which can be obtained in two ways:\\n\\n*   **Conventional function call method** This has already been implemented in the aforementioned cast call.\\n    \\n*   **Reading contract slot storage method** First, based on the WMNT source code, it's determined that the balanceOf state variable is located at the 0th slot with KEY\\\\_TYPE being 'address'.\\n    \\n\\n```\\ncontract WMANTLE is ERC20  {\\n    constructor() ERC20(\\\"Wrapped Mantle\\\", \\\"WMNT\\\") {}\\n    event  Deposit(address indexed dst, uint256 wad);\\n    event  Withdrawal(address indexed src, uint256 wad);\\n...\\n\\ncontract ERC20 is Context, IERC20, IERC20Metadata {\\n    mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;\\n    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) private _allowances;\\n    uint256 private _totalSupply;\\n    string private _name;\\n    string private _symbol;\\n...\\n```\\n\\n```\\n＃ For KEY 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f and slot 0, the corresponding storage location.\\ncast index address 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f 0\\n//0x2edcadc9f197c279f92ccdbf8b108a59937d545e881935fccd2cb58923bc739b\\n\\n＃　Retrieve the raw data from the corresponding storage location, converting from address to integer, address=>int\\ncast storage $WMNT 0x2edcadc9f197c279f92ccdbf8b108a59937d545e881935fccd2cb58923bc739b\\n0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000006cfd1854e3ec57a5d636d\\n```\\n\\n**cast abi-decode / cast abi-encode**\\n\\n[`cast abi-decode`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-abi-decode) can be used to decode any ABI-encoded data. For example, to decode the output data for a `balanceOf` call:\\n\\n> cast abi-decode \\\"balanceOf(address)(uint256)\\\" \\\\\\\\0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a\\n\\n[`cast abi-encode`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-abi-encode) can be used to ABI encode any given function arguments, excluding the selector. For example, to ABI-encode the arguments for a function call:\\n\\n> cast abi-encode \\\"someFunc(address,uint256)\\\" 0x... 1\\n\\n### \\n\\nforge\\n\\n#### \\n\\n5.1 Initialize the project.**\\\\-forge init**\\n\\n> forge init <dir\\\\_name>forge init —template <template\\\\_path> <dir\\\\_name>\\n\\nView the current directory structure.\\n\\n```\\n(base) ➜ tree -L 2\\n.\\n└── hello_foundry\\n    ├── foundry.toml\\n    ├── lib\\n    ├── script\\n    ├── src\\n    └── test\\n```\\n\\n#### \\n\\n5.2 **forge build**\\n\\nThe corresponding compile command is\\n\\n```\\ncd hello_foundry\\nforge build\\nforge build -w\\n```\\n\\nTypically, two panes are opened in tmux.

The $BIT contract remains unchanged.\\nHere’s a list of contract addresses on Goerli that we’ll interact with in this guide:\\nIn this short guide, we’ll go over how to migrate your test $BIT to $MNT on Goerli.

Instead, MNT will be a native Mantle Network L2 asset, instead of a bridged version of its Ethereum ERC-20 counterpart. For more details, please check [here](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/introduct",

Additionally, we have optimized the `estimateGas` function to directly provide an estimate of the total cost of a transaction.

After depositing, you'll need MNT on L2 as gas fees to transact on Mantle Network.\\nWithdraw: You need MNT on L2 as gas fees to initiate the withdrawal and ETH on L1 as gas fees to claim the tokens on Ethereum Mainnet.\\nHow can I view my bridged token balances on Mantle Network in my wallet?​\\nIf the auto-detection of your bridged balances doesn't work, you can manually import the tokens to your wallet using the following contract addresses:\\n0xdEAddEaDdeadDEadDEADDEAddEADDEAddead1111\\nFor other token contract addresses, you can access the bridge token mapping by visiting the following link.\\nWhat is the typical duration for deposits and withdrawals?​\\nInitiati",
    "ng a deposit typically completes in around ~12 minutes.\\nConversely, withdrawals, due to the intricacies of Optimistic Rollups, have a challenge period to detect and address any discrepancies in the Mantle Mainnet transaction.

However, as Mantle Network operates as a layer 2 (L2) blockchain, there are new paradigms in the fee structure that distinguish it from Ethereum's fees.\\nAs Mantle Network continuously enhances its EVM compatibility, dApps can conveniently adapt to any changes with minimal modifications. Let's explore the two sources of transaction costs on Mantle:\\nL1 Rollup Fee\\nCost of submitting rollup state root to L1 (distributed equally among users whose transactions ar",
    "e included in the batch)\\nWrite data credentials submitted to the DA contract on L1\\nThe L2 Execution Fee​\\nSimilar to Ethereum, transactions on Mantle Network must pay the gas fee for the computational and storage resources used. Each L2 transaction incurs some execution fees, calculated as the product of the gas used and the gas price associated with the transaction.\\nMathematically, this is represented as:\\nL2ExecutionFee=L2GasPrice∗L2GasUsedL2ExecutionFee=L2GasPrice∗L2GasUsed\\nThis fee reflects the computational and execution costs of completing transactions on the L2 network. The L2 execution fee paid by users is directly proportional to the computational and network resources consumed by their transactions.\\nThe L1 Rollup Fee​\\nAll state roots generated on L2 due to transaction execution are published to Ethereum. This step is crucial for the security properties of L2, ensuring that all the latest block data from the L2 network is consistently available on Ethereum L1 for sync no",
    "des.\\nL2 aggregates states and essential transaction data into batches, publishing them to Ethereum, with the cost distributed among users whose transactions are included in the batch. The L1 rollup Fee is calculated based on factors such as:\\nThe current gas price on Ethereum\\nA fixed overhead (a fixed cost for committing data to L1, auto-adjusted and set into gas oracle)\\nThe scaling factor scalar\\nParameters related to the size of the transaction are stored as calldata in L1 called rollupDataGas\\nMathematically, this is represented as:\\nL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗scalarL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗scalar\\nThis fee covers the computational costs of integrating and submitting transaction batches from L2 to L1, including the gas needed for data storage and additional overhead. The L1 rollup fee is a crucial component ensuring the overall system's secure operation and also affects the overall transaction costs.\\nFor a more in-depth understanding, ",
    "it is highly recommended to read the Mantle research team's study on fees in Rollups: Transaction Fees on Rollups\\nUnderstanding Fees on Mantle v2 Tectonic​\\nIn Mantle v2 Tectonic, the introduction of Mantle's native token design incorporates a tokenRatio parameter to adjust the fee:\\nL2ExecutionFee=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatioL2ExecutionFee=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatio \\nL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalarL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalar\\nL2 Execution Fee in Mantle v2 Tectonic​\\nThe size of the L2 Execution Fee is primarily influenced by two key factors that directly shape the cost of executing transactions on L2.\\nL2ExecutionFee=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatioL2ExecutionFee=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatio\\nLet's delve into these factors:\\nL2 gasUsed - Complexity of Transaction Execution​\\nL2 gasUsed is the amount of gas consumed to execute a transaction on layer 2. This value is directly related to the complexity of",
    " the transaction and reflects the amount of work involved in executing the contract, computing, and processing the data. As a result, more complex transactions typically require more gas to complete, directly affecting the size of the L2 execution fee. This factor ensures that the transaction fee is proportional to the actual computational resources used.\\nL2 gasPrice - Depends on the transaction type​\\nL2 gasPrice is the unit price of gas used on L2, which depends on the specific transaction type chosen. L2 gasPrice is calculated differently for different transaction types:\\nFor EIP-1559 transaction types, L2 gasPrice is affected by the GasTipCap parameter, which is a parameter that is issued as a reward to sequencers and can be set to 0 by the user and does not affect the packing of transactions.\\nFor legacy transaction types, GasTipCap takes the default value (0.1 GWEI). In this case, eth_gasPrice is equal to the sum of GasTipCap and BASEFEE. This mechanism ensures the relative stab",
    "ility of the transaction costs, while providing the user with default values and simplifying the setup of the transaction parameters.\\nDue to EVM compatibility, transactions on Mantle Network generally have similar gasUsed to Ethereum. Gas prices fluctuate with time and congestion, but you can always check the current estimated L2 Gas prices on the public Mantle dashboard. Moreover, as gas fees on Mantle Network are denominated in $MNT, transaction costs remain significantly lower than other L2 networks using $ETH as the gas token, even at the same gas price.\\nL1 Rollup Fee in Mantle v2 Tectonic​\\nSince the cost of transaction on L1 is much higher than that of transaction on L2, this is the largest part of the total transaction cost, and calculating the cost of L1 is a complex task due to the volatility of gasPrice in L1.\\nL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalarL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalar\\nLet's delve into these factors:\\n",
    "rollupDataGasCalculation​\\nThe major portion of the L1 gas fee is rollupDataGas, which relates to the size of the transaction stored as calldata in L1, and typically accounts for more than 85% of the L1 GasUsed.\\nMantle v2 Tectonic chooses the Op Stack's rollupDataGas calculation, which counts the number of zero bytes and non-zero bytes in the transaction data, with each zero byte costing 4 Gas and each non-zero byte costing 16 Gas, thus:\\nrollupDataGas=count​zero​bytes(tx​data)∗4+count​non​zero​bytes(tx​data)∗16rollupDataGas=count_​zero_​bytes(tx_​data)∗4+count_​non_​zero_​bytes(tx_​data)∗16\\nWith the EigenDA-powered Mantle DA module online with Mantle Mainnet, only state roots and a limited amount of necessary transaction data are sent to L1, while the transaction batch data is posted to the DA network. For dApps with high gas consumption, they can be executed at the same cost as an ordinary transaction (like a transfer), and the L1 fee will not increase with the complexity of L2 tra",
    "nsaction execution. As a result, for transactions with high complexity, this can even save up to more than 90% of the cost compared to the original L1 rollup fee.\\nFetchoverheadandscalar​\\noverhead and scalar are currently loaded from configurations, not supporting dynamic changes, you can fetch them from the BVM_GasPriceOracle contract, while L1gasPrice needs to be read from L1 blocks.\\nControl of tokenRatio​\\ntokenRatio is a parameter adjusting fees in Mantle. By obtaining prices for ETH and MNT from multiple price oracles and calculating their exchange rate (eth_price/mnt_price), Mantle v2 Tectonic limits the value of the current tokenRatio to the interval of the previous tokenRatio to prevent sudden and significant fluctuations in gasPrice caused by abrupt changes in the exchange rate.\\nMantle v2 Tectonic introduces a BVM_GasPriceOracle contract in Layer 2 to manage permissions for setting and updating tokenRatio. Users with permission (a multi-signature address managed through HSM",
    ") can update tokenRatio through an L2 transaction, dynamically adjusting gas fees.\\nFee Optimization​\\nCompared to Mantle v1, Mantle v2 Tectonic has made improvements and optimizations in fee design, including:\\nEIP-1559 Support: Mantle v2 Tectonic will support various transaction types, including EIP-1559, freeing users from the constraints of old transaction structures. For more details, refer to this. \\nWe highly recommend you to set the baseFee to 0.02 gwei and priorityfee to 0 in your L2 transaction. Refer to this for more details.\\nFee Estimation: The estimateGas API in Mantle v1 only returns the L2 gas cost, the L1 gas estimation needs to be calculated separately, while in Mantle v2 Tectonic it will support returning the total gas of the user's transaction directly. Developers also need to be mindful of the impact this optimization may have on transaction construction. For more details about how to calculate the gas fee, refer to this.\\nMantle v2 Tectonic Fee Showcase​\\nMantle v",

    " on L1\\n        \\n    \\n\\n### \\n\\nThe L2 Execution Fee[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/overviews#the-l2-execution-fee)\\n\\nSimilar to Ethereum, transactions on Mantle Network must pay the gas fee for the computational and storage resources used. Each L2 transaction incurs some execution fees, calculated as the product of the gas used and the gas price associated with the transaction.\\n\\nMathematically, this is represented as:\\n\\nL2ExecutionFee\\\\=L2GasPrice∗L2GasUsedL2ExecutionFee=L2GasPrice∗L2GasUsed\\n\\nThis fee reflects the computational and execution costs of completing transactions on the L2 network. The L2 execution fee paid by users is directly proportional to the computational and network resources consumed by their transactions.\\n\\n### \\n\\nThe L1 Rollup Fee[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/overviews#the-l1-rollup-fee)\\n\\nAll state roots generated on L2 due to transaction execution are published to Ethereum. This step is crucial for the securit",
    "y properties of L2, ensuring that all the latest block data from the L2 network is consistently available on Ethereum L1 for sync nodes.\\n\\nL2 aggregates states and essential transaction data into batches, publishing them to Ethereum, with the cost distributed among users whose transactions are included in the batch. The L1 rollup Fee is calculated based on factors such as:\\n\\n*   The current gas price on Ethereum\\n    \\n*   A fixed `overhead` (a fixed cost for committing data to L1, auto-adjusted and set into gas oracle)\\n    \\n*   The scaling factor `scalar`\\n    \\n*   Parameters related to the size of the transaction are stored as calldata in L1 called `rollupDataGas`\\n    \\n\\nMathematically, this is represented as:\\n\\nL1RollupFee\\\\=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗scalarL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗scalar\\n\\nThis fee covers the computational costs of integrating and submitting transaction batches from L2 to L1, including the gas needed for data storage and add",
    "itional overhead. The L1 rollup fee is a crucial component ensuring the overall system's secure operation and also affects the overall transaction costs.\\n\\nFor a more in-depth understanding, it is highly recommended to read the Mantle research team's study on fees in Rollups: [Transaction Fees on Rollups](https://www.mantle.xyz/blog/research/transaction-fees-on-rollups)\\n\\n## \\n\\nUnderstanding Fees on Mantle v2 Tectonic[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/overviews#understanding-fees-on-mantle-v2-tectonic)\\n\\nIn Mantle v2 Tectonic, the introduction of Mantle's native token design incorporates a [`tokenRatio`](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/system-information/fee-mechanism#control-of-tokenratio) parameter to adjust the fee:\\n\\nL2ExecutionFee\\\\=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatioL2ExecutionFee=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatio\\n\\nL1RollupFee\\\\=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalarL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalar\\n\\n### \\n\\nL2 Ex",
    "ecution Fee in Mantle v2 Tectonic[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/overviews#l2-execution-fee-in-mantle-v2-tectonic)\\n\\nThe size of the L2 Execution Fee is primarily influenced by two key factors that directly shape the cost of executing transactions on L2.\\n\\nL2ExecutionFee\\\\=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatioL2ExecutionFee=L2gasPrice∗L2gasUsed∗tokenRatio\\n\\nLet's delve into these factors:\\n\\n#### \\n\\n**L2 gasUsed - Complexity of Transaction Execution**[**​**](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/overviews#l2-gasused---complexity-of-transaction-execution)\\n\\nL2 gasUsed is the amount of gas consumed to execute a transaction on layer 2. This value is directly related to the complexity of the transaction and reflects the amount of work involved in executing the contract, computing, and processing the data. As a result, more complex transactions typically require more gas to complete, directly affecting the size of the L2 execution fee. This factor ensures that t",
    "he transaction fee is proportional to the actual computational resources used.\\n\\n#### \\n\\n**L2 gasPrice - Depends on the transaction type**[**​**](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/overviews#l2-gasprice---depends-on-the-transaction-type)\\n\\nL2 gasPrice is the unit price of gas used on L2, which depends on the specific transaction type chosen. L2 gasPrice is calculated differently for different transaction types:\\n\\n*   **For** [**EIP-1559 transaction types**](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/more/glossary#eip-1559-transaction), L2 gasPrice is affected by the `GasTipCap` parameter, which is a parameter that is issued as a reward to sequencers and can be set to `0` by the user and does not affect the packing of transactions.\\n    \\n*   **For** [**legacy transaction types**](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/more/glossary#legacy-transaction), `GasTipCap` takes the default value (0.1 GWEI). In this case, `eth_gasPrice` is equal to the sum of `GasTipCap` and `BASEFEE`. This mech",
    "anism ensures the relative stability of the transaction costs, while providing the user with default values and simplifying the setup of the transaction parameters.\\n    \\n\\nDue to EVM compatibility, transactions on Mantle Network generally have similar `gasUsed` to Ethereum. Gas prices fluctuate with time and congestion, but you can always check the current estimated L2 Gas prices on the public Mantle dashboard. Moreover, as gas fees on Mantle Network are denominated in `$MNT`, transaction costs remain significantly lower than other L2 networks using $ETH as the gas token, even at the same gas price.\\n\\n### \\n\\nL1 Rollup Fee in Mantle v2 Tectonic[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/overviews#l1-rollup-fee-in-mantle-v2-tectonic)\\n\\nSince the cost of transaction on L1 is much higher than that of transaction on L2, this is the largest part of the total transaction cost, and calculating the cost of L1 is a complex task due to the volatility of gasPrice in L1.\\n\\nL1RollupFee",
    "\\\\=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalarL1RollupFee=(rollupDataGas+overhead)∗L1gasPrice∗tokenRatio∗scalar\\n\\nLet's delve into these factors:\\n\\n#### \\n\\n`**rollupDataGas**`**Calculation**[**​**](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/overviews#rollupdatagas-calculation)\\n\\nThe major portion of the L1 gas fee is `rollupDataGas`, which relates to the size of the transaction stored as calldata in L1, and typically accounts for more than 85% of the L1 GasUsed.\\n\\nMantle v2 Tectonic chooses the Op Stack's rollupDataGas calculation, which counts the number of zero bytes and non-zero bytes in the transaction data, with each zero byte costing 4 Gas and each non-zero byte costing 16 Gas, thus:\\n\\nrollupDataGas\\\\=count​zero​bytes(tx​data)∗4+count​non​zero​bytes(tx​data)∗16rollupDataGas=count\\\\_​zero\\\\_​bytes(tx\\\\_​data)∗4+count\\\\_​non\\\\_​zero\\\\_​bytes(tx\\\\_​data)∗16\\n\\nWith the EigenDA-powered Mantle DA module online with Mantle Mainnet, only state roots and a limited am",
    "ount of necessary transaction data are sent to L1, while the transaction batch data is posted to the DA network. For dApps with high gas consumption, they can be executed at the same cost as an ordinary transaction (like a transfer), and the L1 fee will not increase with the complexity of L2 transaction execution. As a result, for transactions with high complexity, this can even save up to more than **90%** of the cost compared to the original L1 rollup fee.\\n\\n#### \\n\\n**Fetch**`**overhead**`**and**`**scalar**`[**​**](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/overviews#fetch-overhead-and-scalar)\\n\\n`overhead` and `scalar` are currently loaded from configurations, not supporting dynamic changes, you can fetch them from the [`BVM_GasPriceOracle`](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/system-information/off-chain-system/key-l2-contract-address) contract, while `L1gasPrice` needs to be read from L1 blocks.\\n\\n#### \\n\\n**Control of tokenRatio**[**​**](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concep",
    "ts/tx-fee/overviews#control-of-tokenratio)\\n\\n`tokenRatio` is a parameter adjusting fees in Mantle. By obtaining prices for ETH and MNT from multiple price oracles and calculating their exchange rate (`eth_price/mnt_price`), Mantle v2 Tectonic limits the value of the current `tokenRatio` to the interval of the previous `tokenRatio` to prevent sudden and significant fluctuations in gasPrice caused by abrupt changes in the exchange rate.\\n\\nMantle v2 Tectonic introduces a [`BVM_GasPriceOracle`](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/system-information/off-chain-system/key-l2-contract-address) contract in Layer 2 to manage permissions for setting and updating `tokenRatio`. Users with permission (a multi-signature address managed through [HSM](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/more/glossary#hardware-security-module-hsm)) can update `tokenRatio` through an L2 transaction, dynamically adjusting gas fees.\\n\\n## \\n\\nFee Optimization[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/overviews#fee-optim",
    "ization)\\n\\nCompared to Mantle v1, Mantle v2 Tectonic has made improvements and optimizations in fee design, including:\\n\\n*   **EIP-1559 Support**: Mantle v2 Tectonic will support various transaction types, including EIP-1559, freeing users from the constraints of old transaction structures. For more details, refer to [this](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/system-information/fee-mechanism/eip-1559-support).\\n    \\n\\n**We highly recommend you to set the** `**baseFee**` **to** `**0.02 gwei**` **and** `**priorityfee**` **to** `**0**` **in your L2 transaction.** Refer to [this](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-developers/optimize-your-transaction-fees) for more details.\\n\\n*   **Fee Estimation**: The `estimateGas` API in Mantle v1 only returns the L2 gas cost, the L1 gas estimation needs to be calculated separately, while in Mantle v2 Tectonic it will support returning the total gas of the user's transaction directly. Developers also need to be mindful of the impact this optimization m",
    "ay have on transaction construction.

For detailed information, please refer to this.\\nHow to Obtain rollupDataGas​\\nIt's essential to note that rollupDataGas is not constructed during the estimateGas process in the OP Stack codebase. Thus, an interface is needed to estimate the cost. Mantle addresses this by constructing rollupDataGas and introducing a constant to cover V, R, S signatures, and other data, ensuring that the estimateGas's gasLimit covers L1 costs.\\nWe provide interfaces that return L1GasUsed data directly, i.e., th",

To prevent transaction failure due to insufficient gas fees, Mantle Network internally magnifies the estimate by a factor, ensuring the correct execution of transactions.\\nWhy Do We Need to UseestimateGas​\\nThe cost of fees on L1 is difficult to predict accurately due to the influence of L1 gasPrice, therefore, in Mantle v1, the estimateGas function only returns an estimate of the L2 gas fee. However, in Mantle v2 Tectonic, we have addressed this issue by providing an optimized solution. The estimateGas interface now returns an estimate of the total gas fee, including both L1 and L2 costs. Consequently, when constructing transactions, adjustments need to be made to accomm",
    "odate this optimization. We encourage all transactions to first call estimateGas to obtain an estimate of the gas fee before construction.\\nExample​\\nHere is an example illustrating the difference in gasLimit settings for transaction construction between Mantle v1 and Mantle v2 Tectonic.\\nIn Mantle v1, the gasUsed on a typical native token transfer on L2 is a fixed value (21,000), so developers might opt to skip calling estimateGas and set it to a fixed value.\\nHowever, in Mantle v2 Tectonic, the gasLimit that developers need to set when constructing transactions will include both L1 and L2 components, so without calling estimateGas and setting it to a fixed value may result in transaction failures.\\nTo avoid transaction failures, we recommend calling estimateGas when constructing transactions to obtain an estimate of the gas fee.\\nIf you want to do estimateGas with the Mantle SDK, here's a demo.\\nLast updated 2 months ago\",\n  \"markdown\": \"# Estimate Fees | Network\\n\\n## \\n\\nEstimate F",

To prevent transaction failure due to insufficient gas fees, Mantle Network internally magnifies the estimate by a factor, ensuring the correct execution of transactions.\\n\\n## \\n\\n",
    "Why Do We Need to Use`estimateGas`[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/ef#why-we-need-to-use-estimategas)\\n\\nThe cost of fees on L1 is difficult to predict accurately due to the influence of L1 gasPrice, therefore, in Mantle v1, the `estimateGas` function only returns an estimate of the L2 gas fee. However, in Mantle v2 Tectonic, we have addressed this issue by providing an optimized solution. The `estimateGas` interface now returns an estimate of the total gas fee, including both L1 and L2 costs. Consequently, when constructing transactions, adjustments need to be made to accommodate this optimization. We encourage all transactions to first call `estimateGas` to obtain an estimate of the gas fee before construction.\\n\\n### \\n\\nExample[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/concepts/tx-fee/ef#example)\\n\\nHere is an example illustrating the difference in `gasLimit` settings for transaction construction between Mantle v1 and Mantle v2 Tectonic.\\n\\nIn Mantle v1, the `gasUsed` o",
    "n a typical native token transfer on L2 is a fixed value (21,000), so developers might opt to skip calling `estimateGas` and set it to a fixed value.\\n\\nHowever, in Mantle v2 Tectonic, the `gasLimit` that developers need to set when constructing transactions will include both L1 and L2 components, so without calling `estimateGas` and setting it to a fixed value may result in transaction failures.\\n\\n**To avoid transaction failures, we recommend calling** `**estimateGas**` **when constructing transactions to obtain an estimate of the gas fee.**\\n\\nIf you want to do `estimateGas` with the Mantle SDK, here's a [demo](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-tutorial/tree/main/sdk-estimate-gas).\\n\\nLast updated 2 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-developers/resources-and-tooling/account-abstraction/social-login-by-using-particle\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-developers/re",

It supports social logins and standard Web3 options via WalletConnect and includes Account Abstraction (AA) with a simpleAccount instance, version 2.0.0. The configured ConnectKitProvider component wraps the app’s content, ensuring this setup is accessible throughout the application.\\nIntegrate Particle Connect in Your App \\nAfter configuration, wrap your application with the ParticleConnectKit component to provide access to the Particle Connect ",
    "SDK across the app. Update the layout.tsx file in the src directory as follows:\\nimport { ParticleConnectkit } from \\\"@/components/Connectkit\\\"; import type { Metadata } from \\\"next\\\"; import { Inter } from \\\"next/font/google\\\"; import \\\"./globals.css\\\"; const inter = Inter({ subsets: [\\\"latin\\\"] }); export const metadata: Metadata = { title: \\\"Particle Connectkit App\\\", description: \\\"Generated by create next app\\\", }; export default function RootLayout({ children, }: Readonly<{ children: React.ReactNode; }>) { return ( <html lang=\\\"en\\\"> <body className={inter.className}> <ParticleConnectkit>{children}</ParticleConnectkit> </body> </html> ); }\\nBuilding the Application \\nWith your project set up, dependencies installed, and Particle Connect configured, you can start building in the page.tsx file.\\nIn page.tsx, you’ll define the core features: login flow, data visualization, transaction handling, and the UI.\\nConnecting the Wallet \\nWith layout.tsx set up, the next step is to add a ma",

    "n```\\n\\n## \\n\\nBuilding the Application\\n\\nWith your project set up, dependencies installed, and Particle Connect configured, you can start building in the `page.tsx` file.\\n\\nIn `page.tsx`, you’ll define the core features: login flow, data visualization, transaction handling, and the UI.\\n\\n### \\n\\nConnecting the Wallet\\n\\nWith `layout.tsx` set up, the next step is to add a main **Connect Wallet** button for user login. Import `ConnectButton` from `@particle-network/connectkit` and add it to the interface. Once the user logs in, the `ConnectButton` transforms into an embedded wallet widget.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"use client\\\";\\nimport { ConnectButton, useAccount } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit\\\";\\n\\nconst HomePage = () => {\\n  const { address, isConnected, chainId } = useAccount();\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\\"flex justify-center items-center h-screen\\\">\\n      <div className=\\\"text-center\\\">\\n        <ConnectButton />\\n        {isConnected && (\\n          <>\\n            <h2>Address:",
    " {address}</h2>\\n            <h2>Chain ID: {chainId}</h2>\\n          </>\\n        )}\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n};\\n\\nexport default HomePage;\\n```\\n\\n### \\n\\nSending Transactions with an EIP-1193 Provider\\n\\nParticle Connect offers built-in AA features, but pairing it with the Particle AA SDK lets you leverage EIP-1193 providers like `ethers`. This setup is particularly useful if you’re already accustomed to these providers or if you’re integrating Particle Connect into an existing application.\\n\\nTo set this up, wrap the smart account from Particle Connect within an `ethers` instance to create a `customProvider`. This lets you interact with ethers as usual while the smart account manages transaction signing in the background.\\n\\n```\\nimport {useSmartAccount } from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit\\\";\\nimport { AAWrapProvider, SendTransactionMode } from \\\"@particle-network/aa\\\";\\n\\nconst smartAccount = useSmartAccount();\\n\\n// Init custom provider with gasless transaction mode\\ncon",
    "st customProvider = smartAccount\\n? new ethers.BrowserProvider(\\n    new AAWrapProvider(\\n        smartAccount,\\n        SendTransactionMode.Gasless\\n    ) as Eip1193Provider,\\n    \\\"any\\\"\\n    )\\n: null;\\n\\n/**\\n * Sends a transaction using the ethers.js library.\\n * This transaction is gasless since the customProvider is initialized as gasless\\n*/\\nconst executeTxEthers = async () => {\\n    if (!customProvider) return;\\n  \\n    const signer = await customProvider.getSigner();\\n    const tx = {\\n      to: recipientAddress,\\n      value: parseEther(\\\"0.01\\\").toString(),\\n    };\\n  \\n    const txResponse = await signer.sendTransaction(tx);\\n    const txReceipt = await txResponse.wait();\\n    console.log(txReceipt?.hash)\\n  };\\n```\\n\\nThis transaction is gasless due to two factors:\\n\\n1.  **Gasless Mode:** Setting `SendTransactionMode.Gasless` in `AAWrapProvider` specifies a sponsored transaction.\\n    \\n2.  **Funding:** On Testnets like Mantle Sepolia, transactions are automatically spo",
    "nsored, so no USDT is needed. On mainnets, the Paymaster (configured in the [Particle dashboar](https://dashboard.particle.network/)d) must be funded to cover transaction fees.\\n    \\n\\nThis example uses an EIP-1193 provider, though you can also create a userOp directly with Particle Connect. For details, see the [starter repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/connectkit-aa-usage/blob/2017262daf297624362d51f3d50cccd3b4606ef9/app/page.tsx#L117).\\n\\n## \\n\\nFull App Example\\n\\nWith an understanding of each part, you can now use Particle Connect, as shown in the example application below.\\n\\nThis application creates a smart account on Mantle Sepolia through either social or Web3 login and sends a gasless transaction of 0.01 MNT using the `ethers` provider.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"use client\\\";\\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from \\\"react\\\";\\n\\n// Particle imports\\nimport {\\n  ConnectButton,\\n  useAccount,\\n  usePublicClient,\\n  useSmartAccount,\\n} from \\\"@particle-network/connectkit\\\";\\n",

    "xt app and sets the name of the Next app as “appkit-example”.\\nInstall AppKit\\nNow, we need to install AppKit and other dependencies that we need for our app to function as expected. For this tutorial, we will be using “wagmi” as our preferred Ethereum library. \\nnpm install @reown/appkit @reown/appkit-wagmi-adapter wagmi @tanstack/react-query\\nReown also supports wagmi v1, ethers, ethers v5, if you want to use other sdk, please refer to their documentation here.\\nCreate a New Project on Reown Cloud\\nNow, we need to get a project Id from Reown Cloud that we will use to set up AppKit with Wagmi config. Navigate to cloud.reown.com and sign in. If you have not created an account yet, please do so before we proceed.\\nAfter you have logged in, please navigate to the “Projects” section of the Cloud and click on “Create Project”.\\nNow, enter the name for your project and click on “Continue”.\\nSelect the product as “AppKit” and click on “Continue”.\\nSelect the framework as “Next.js” and click ",

On the top left corner, you will be able to find your Project Id. Please copy that as you will need that later.\\nBuild the App Using AppKit\\nBefore we build the app, let’s first configure our .env file. On the root level of your code directory, create a new file named .env.\\nOpen that file and create a new variable NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID. You will assign the project Id that you copied in the previous step to this environment variable that you just created. This is what it will look like:\\nNEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID = <YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE>\\nPlease make sure you follow the best practices when you are working with secret keys and other sensitive information. Env",
    "ironment variables that start with NEXT_PUBLIC will be exposed by your app which can be misused by bad actors.\\nConfigure AppKit\\nOn the root level of your code directory, create a new folder named config and within that folder, create a new code file named config/index.tsx. Now, paste the code snippet shared below inside the code file, i.e., config/index.tsx.TypeScriptCopy\\nimport { WagmiAdapter } from \\\"@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi\\\"; import { cookieStorage, createStorage } from \\\"wagmi\\\"; import { mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet } from '@reown/appkit/networks' // Get projectId from https://cloud.reown.com export const projectId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID; export const networks = [mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet] if (!projectId) throw new Error(\\\"Project ID is not defined\\\"); // Set up the Wagmi Adapter (config) export const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({ storage: createStorage({ storage: cookieStorage }), ssr: true, networks, projectId }) export const config = wagmiAdapter.wag",

After this, we need to create the modal component for our app.\\nmetadata - This object contains information about our application that will be used by AppKit. This includes the name of the app, the description, the url and the icons representing our app. This is optional.\\ncreateAppKit - this is called to initialize the AppKit component, which handles the user interface for connecting to blockchain wallets. The function is configured with various options, such as the app's metadata, theming, and enabling features like analytics and onramp services.\\nnetworks - these are the networks that we want our app to support. So import the ",
    "chains you want your app to support from @reown/appkit/network and assign it to this network parameter.

Configure a wallet connection modal and enable interactions with the Mantle network.\\n    \\n\\nThis guide takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.\\n\\nLet’s get started!\\n\\n### \\n\\nSetup\\n\\nIn this section, you'll learn how to set up the development environment to use AppKit with Mantle.\\n\\nFor this tutorial, we'll be using Next.js, though you can use any other framework compatible with AppKit.\\n\\n_AppKit is available on eight frameworks, including React, Next.js, Vue, JavaScript, React Native, Flutter, Android, iOS, and Unity._\\n\\nNow, let’s create a Next app. In order to do so, please run the command given below:\\n\\n```\\nnpx create-next-app@latest appkit-example\\n```\\n\\nThe above command crea",
    "tes a Next app and sets the name of the Next app as “appkit-example”.\\n\\n#### \\n\\nInstall AppKit\\n\\nNow, we need to install AppKit and other dependencies that we need for our app to function as expected. For this tutorial, we will be using “wagmi” as our preferred Ethereum library.\\n\\n```\\nnpm install @reown/appkit @reown/appkit-wagmi-adapter wagmi @tanstack/react-query\\n```\\n\\nReown also supports wagmi v1, ethers, ethers v5, if you want to use other sdk, please refer to their documentation [here](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/installation).\\n\\n#### \\n\\nCreate a New Project on Reown Cloud\\n\\nNow, we need to get a project Id from Reown Cloud that we will use to set up AppKit with Wagmi config. Navigate to [cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com/) and sign in. If you have not created an account yet, please do so before we proceed.\\n\\nAfter you have logged in, please navigate to the “**Projects**” section of the Cloud and click on “**Create Project**”.\\n\\nNow, enter the name ",
    "for your project and click on “**Continue**”.\\n\\nSelect the product as “**AppKit**” and click on “**Continue**”.\\n\\nSelect the framework as “**Next.js**” and click on “**Create**”. Reown Cloud will now create a new project for you which will also generate a project Id.\\n\\nYou will notice that your project was successfully created. On the top left corner, you will be able to find your Project Id. Please copy that as you will need that later.\\n\\nYou will notice that your project was successfully created. On the top left corner, you will be able to find your Project Id. Please copy that as you will need that later.\\n\\n### \\n\\nBuild the App Using AppKit\\n\\nBefore we build the app, let’s first configure our .env file. On the root level of your code directory, create a new file named .env.\\n\\nOpen that file and create a new variable NEXT\\\\_PUBLIC\\\\_PROJECT\\\\_ID. You will assign the project Id that you copied in the previous step to this environment variable that you just created. This is wha",
    "t it will look like:\\n\\n```\\nNEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID = <YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE>\\n```\\n\\n_Please make sure you follow the best practices when you are working with secret keys and other sensitive information. Environment variables that start with NEXT\\\\_PUBLIC will be exposed by your app which can be misused by bad actors._\\n\\n#### \\n\\nConfigure AppKit\\n\\nOn the root level of your code directory, create a new folder named config and within that folder, create a new code file named config/index.tsx. Now, paste the code snippet shared below inside the code file, i.e., `config/index.tsx.TypeScriptCopy`\\n\\n```\\nimport { WagmiAdapter } from \\\"@reown/appkit-adapter-wagmi\\\";\\nimport { cookieStorage, createStorage } from \\\"wagmi\\\";\\nimport { mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet } from '@reown/appkit/networks'\\n\\n// Get projectId from https://cloud.reown.com\\nexport const projectId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID;\\n\\nexport const networks = [mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet]\\n\\nif (!projectId) throw new Er",
    "ror(\\\"Project ID is not defined\\\");\\n\\n// Set up the Wagmi Adapter (config)\\nexport const wagmiAdapter = new WagmiAdapter({\\n  storage: createStorage({\\n    storage: cookieStorage\\n  }),\\n  ssr: true,\\n  networks,\\n  projectId\\n})\\n\\nexport const config = wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig\\n```\\n\\nSo what's happening in the above code? Let's understand it step-by-step:\\n\\nFirst, we need to import the necessary functions from their respective packages.\\n\\n**WagmiAdapter -** this is used to create a WAGMI configuration which is then initialized to the wagmiAdapter\\n\\n**cookieStorage, createStorage -** this provides a storage mechanism using cookies and a function to create custom storage solutions (in this case, using cookies).\\n\\n#### \\n\\nCreate the Modal for your app\\n\\nNow, we need to create a context provider to wrap our application in and initialize AppKit.\\n\\nOn the root level of your code directory, create a new folder named context and within that folder, create a new code file named conte",
    "xt/index.tsx. Now, paste the code snippet shared below inside the code file, i.e., `context/index.tsx`.\\n\\n```\\n'use client'\\n\\nimport { wagmiAdapter, projectId } from '@/config'\\nimport { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit/react' \\nimport { mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet } from '@reown/appkit/networks'\\n\\nimport { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'\\nimport React, { type ReactNode } from 'react'\\nimport { cookieToInitialState, WagmiProvider, type Config } from 'wagmi'\\n\\n// Set up queryClient\\nconst queryClient = new QueryClient()\\n\\nif (!projectId) {\\n  throw new Error('Project ID is not defined')\\n}\\n\\n// Set up metadata\\nconst metadata = { //this is optional\\n  name: \\\"appkit-example-mantle\\\",\\n  description: \\\"AppKit Example - Mantle\\\",\\n  url: \\\"https://mantleapp.com\\\", // origin must match your domain & subdomain\\n  icons: [\\\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179229932\\\"]\\n}\\n\\n// Create the modal\\nconst modal = createAppKit({\\n  adapters: [wagmiA",
    "dapter],\\n  projectId,\\n  networks: [mantle, mantleSepoliaTestnet],\\n  metadata: metadata,\\n  features: {\\n    analytics: true, // Optional - defaults to your Cloud configuration\\n  },\\n  themeMode: 'light'\\n})\\n\\nfunction ContextProvider({ children, cookies }: { children: ReactNode; cookies: string | null }) {\\n  const initialState = cookieToInitialState(wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig as Config, cookies)\\n\\n  return (\\n    <WagmiProvider config={wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig as Config} initialState={initialState}>\\n      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>\\n    </WagmiProvider>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\nexport default ContextProvider\\n```\\n\\nLet’s understand what is happening in the above code:\\n\\nFirst, we import the necessary functions from their respective packages. After this, we need to create the modal component for our app.\\n\\n*   **metadata** - This object contains information about our application that will be used by AppKit. This includes the name of the app, th",
    "e description, the url and the icons representing our app. **This is optional.**\\n    \\n*   `createAppKit` - this is called to initialize the AppKit component, which handles the user interface for connecting to blockchain wallets. The function is configured with various options, such as the app's metadata, theming, and enabling features like analytics and onramp services.\\n    \\n*   **networks -** these are the networks that we want our app to support. So import the chains you want your app to support from `@reown/appkit/network` and assign it to this network parameter. Since we want to enable wallet interactions on the Mantle network, we import both Mantle Mainnet and the Sepolia testnet. You can view the complete list of supported chains [here](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/chains).\\n    \\n*   **WagmiProvider**: Provides blockchain and wallet connection context to the app.\\n    \\n*   **QueryClientProvider**: Provides the React Query context for managing server-state data.\\n    \\n\\nNow, l",
    "et’s create the layout for our app. In `app/layout.tsx`, remove the existing code and paste the code snippet given below.\\n\\n```\\nimport type { Metadata } from \\\"next\\\";\\nimport { Inter } from \\\"next/font/google\\\";\\nimport \\\"./globals.css\\\";\\n\\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: [\\\"latin\\\"] });\\n\\nimport { headers } from \\\"next/headers\\\"; // added\\nimport ContextProvider from '@/context'\\n\\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\\n  title: \\\"AppKit Example App\\\",\\n  description: \\\"Powered by Reown\\\"\\n};\\n\\nexport default function RootLayout({\\n  children\\n}: Readonly<{\\n  children: React.ReactNode\\n}>) {\\n  const cookies = headers().get('cookie')\\n\\n  return (\\n    <html lang=\\\"en\\\">\\n      <body className={inter.className}>\\n        <ContextProvider cookies={cookies}>{children}</ContextProvider>\\n      </body>\\n    </html>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### \\n\\nCreate the UI for your app\\n\\nFor our app to have the UI with which your users can interact, you need to set a simple UI and configure the modal. S",
    "ince, we have already set up AppKit, you can use <w3m-button> which will serve as a “Connect Wallet” button or you can build your own custom button using the [hooks](https://docs.walletconnect.com/appkit/next/core/hooks) that AppKit provides.\\n\\nOpen the app/page.tsx file and remove the existing boilerplate code, and then replace it with the code snippet given below.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"use client\\\";\\nimport { useAccount } from \\\"wagmi\\\";\\n\\nexport default function Home() {\\n  const { isConnected } = useAccount();\\n\\n  return (\\n    <main className=\\\"min-h-screen px-8 py-0 pb-12 flex-1 flex flex-col items-center\\\">\\n      <header className=\\\"w-full py-4 flex justify-between items-center\\\">\\n        <div className=\\\"flex items-center\\\">\\n          <img src=\\\"/walletconnect.png\\\" alt=\\\"logo\\\" className=\\\"w-10 h-10 mr-2\\\" />\\n          <div className=\\\"hidden sm:inline text-xl font-bold\\\">Reown - AppKit + Mantle</div>\\n        </div>\\n      </header>\\n      <h2 className=\\\"my-8 text-2xl font-bold l",
    "eading-snug text-center\\\">Examples</h2>\\n      <div className=\\\"max-w-4xl\\\">\\n        <div className=\\\"grid bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-sm\\\">\\n          <h3 className=\\\"text-sm font-semibold bg-gray-100 p-2 text-center\\\">Connect your wallet</h3>\\n          <div className=\\\"flex justify-center items-center p-4\\\">\\n          <w3m-button />\\n          </div>\\n        </div> \\n        <br></br>\\n        {isConnected && (\\n          <div className=\\\"grid bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-sm\\\">\\n            <h3 className=\\\"text-sm font-semibold bg-gray-100 p-2 text-center\\\">Network selection button</h3>\\n            <div className=\\\"flex justify-center items-center p-4\\\">\\n              <w3m-network-button />\\n            </div>\\n          </div>\\n        )}\\n      </div>\\n    </main>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe code above uses the AppKit configuration to provide two buttons: one for users to connect their wallet to the app, and ",
    "another to allow users to switch networks.\\n\\nYou can now run the app and test it out. In order to do so, run the command given below.\\n\\n### \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAnd that’s it! You have now learned how to create a simple app using AppKit that allows users to connect their wallet and interact with the Mantle network.\\n\\n**Reown AppKit** is a powerful solution for developers looking to integrate wallet connections and other Web3 functionalities into their apps on any EVM chain.

The current Mantle DA version is supported by EigenDA technology and authorized by EigenLabs. Throughout development, the Mantle team has been closely collaborating with the EigenLayer team to explore this streamlined solution. Once the standardized solution of EigenDA is ready for mainnet launch, Mantle will migrate its DA component to EigenDA for more efficient data availability. Additionally, Mantle DA allows permissioned nodes to provide data availability services to Mantle network, requiring $MNT staking to ensure network security. For more details, refer here.\\nFor Mantle DA, rollup data is available here: State Roots on L1, Rollup Tx Data on L1, and DA Rollup Tx on L2.\\nSee the section on DA Nodes to find out more about how the different participating actors that are part of the Mantle DA module ",

Independent DA Modules:[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/intro/risk-management/da#4-independent-da-modules)\\n\\nInnovative approaches include independent DA modules, such as Mantle DA supported by EigenLayer's EigenDA technology. This method achieves data availability through a game theory of DA economics involving rewards and stake slashing. According to internal assessments, this solution can save more than **90%** of costs compared to on-chain L1 methods, providing efficient data availability with economic incentives.\\n\\n## \\n\\nMantle DA - Powered by EigenDA Technology[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/intro/risk-management/da#mantle-da---powere",

This is achieved through the re-staking mechanism, where L1 validators can choose to provide data availability services, using their staked ETH as collateral and complying with additional performance conditions.\\n\\nThink of it as middleware for Ethereum.\\n\\nSimilar to how [Optimistic rollups](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/more/glossary#optimistic-rollup) use economic incentives to maintain system integrity, this mechanism provides incentives for Ethereum validators to offer services for additional income opportunities.

The current Mantle DA version is supported by EigenDA technology and authorized by EigenLabs. Throughout development, the Mantle team has been closely collaborating with the EigenLayer team to explore this streamlined solution. Once the standardized solution of EigenDA is ready for mainnet launch, Mantle will migrate its DA component to EigenDA for more efficient data availability. Additionally, Mantle DA allows permissioned nodes to provide data availability services to Mantle network, requiring $MNT staking to ensure network security. For more details, refer [here](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/system-information/off-chain-system/mantle-da).\\n\\nFor Mantle DA, rollup data is available ",

    "Mantle[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/common/cex#deposits-and-withdrawals-on-mantle)\\n\\nThe ERC-20 contracts on Mantle function the same way they do on Ethereum, so you can use your existing code for withdrawals and deposits. Just connect to a Mantle endpoint.\\n\\n### \\n\\nDeposits and Withdrawals Across Chains[​](https://docs-v2.mantle.xyz/devs/dev-guides/common/cex#deposits-and-withdrawals-across-chains)\\n\\nAs a centralized exchange, there will be times that withdrawals of `$ETH/$MNT` token or an ERC-20 token on either Mantle network or Ethereum exceed deposits and you need to transfer assets. To do that you use a bridge or a gateway. We have a standard bridge that receives assets on Ethereum mainnet, and mints the equivalent asset on Mantle network.\\n\\nWhen a user wants to withdraw the assets back to L1, the bridge burns the asset on L2 and releases it to the user on L1. If you want to use this gateway automatically, follow this [tutorial for bridging ETH](https://mantl",
    "enetworkio.github.io/mantle-tutorial/cross-dom-bridge-eth/), or this [tutorial for bridging ERC-20 tokens](https://mantlenetworkio.github.io/mantle-tutorial/cross-dom-bridge-erc20/).\\n\\nNote that while L1 to L2 transactions typically take minutes, L2 to L1 transactions on the gateway require a 7 day challenge period.\\n\\nWhen an ERC-20 token does not have a Mantle equivalent you can create one. If there is no need for custom business logic, you can follow the steps in this [tutorial for bridging standard ERC-20s](https://mantlenetworkio.github.io/mantle-tutorial/standard-bridge-standard-token/). If you need to implement some kind of custom logic, see this [tutorial for bridging custom ERC-20s](https://mantlenetworkio.github.io/mantle-tutorial/standard-bridge-custom-token/).\\n\\nLast updated 3 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/for-developers/common-use-cases/adding-mantle-wallet-support\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedU",

So it is recommended that you should add a timeout parameter with the call or set hingher timeout parameter accordingly to solve the timeout issue.\\n\\n## \\n\\nSmart Contracts\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\\\- Contract deploy error: **ProviderError: too many arguments, want at most 1**\\n\\nIf you run into this issue when deploying your contract, you're probably running a newer version of Hardhat. Try manually specifying the gas limit when deploying your contract, like so:\\n\\n```\\nconst MyNFT = await hre.ethers.deployContract(\\\"ContractNam",
    "e\\\", {\\n    gasLimit: \\\"0x1000000\\\",\\n  });\\n```\\n\\nIf the issue persists, we recommend initializing your project with an older version of \\bHardhat (v2.14) by running the following command:\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\\\- Contract verification error: Hardhat found multiple contracts in the project (your MyTokenContract and the imported @openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol), and it doesn't know against which one you want to verify the bytecode\\n\\nIf you see this error, try verifying the contract again by specifying the name of the contract that you're looking to verify. You can do this using the `--contract` option. Here's an example:\\n\\n```\\nnpx hardhat verify --contract \\\"contracts/MyTokenContract.sol:MyToken\\\" --network mantleTest 0x3A2b26...\\n```\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\\\- Contract invocation error: Bytecode does not match, please try again\\n\\nIf you encounter this error, check the following:\\n\\n*   Whether the compiler version is the same\\n    \\n*   Whether the optimization runs match (if you've ena",
    "bled optimization)\\n    \\n*   Whether the contract name matches exactly as specified in the source code\\n    \\n\\n## \\n\\nStandard Bridge\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\\\- Error when withdrawing: no bridge found for token pair\\n\\nTry switching to a different RPC provider. Available RPCs: [Node RPC Providers](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/resources-and-tooling/node-rpc-providers)\\n\\n## \\n\\nExplorer\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\\\- Error: Awaiting internal transactions for reason\\n\\nYou may encounter this error if you there are multiple internal transaction calls in the contract being invoked. This does not necessarily mean the transaction has failed, just that the explorer is yet to receive acknowledgements for all the internal transactions.\\n\\nLast updated 11 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/concepts/fraud-proofs\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/concepts/fr",

    "re and Roadmap | Network\\nComponents and modules part of Mantle Network\\nMantle v2 Tectonic has been released, please move to the new documentation!\\nNetwork Architecture\\nThis diagram illustrates how different network modules and components interact with each other going through transaction execution and eventually published updated state data to Ethereum L1, and storing the rollup data on the Mantle Data Availability (DA) powered by EigenDA technology. Let's go over the process of transaction handling to better understand how each module works.\\nUsers send signed transactions via an available RPC node.\\nThe Sequencer receives transactions and pack them into blocks. The DTL (Data Transport Layer) service syncs this block data. Verifiers sync the L2 block data from the DTL.\\nThe batch submitter fetches updated state roots and sends them to the Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) module to be verified and signed. Verifiers can also fetch the state root data and confirm their validity.\\nOnc",
    "e TSS nodes establish the validity of the updated state roots and sign off on the rollup batches, the batch submitter publishes the state root data to the State Commitment Chain (SCC) contract on L1 Ethereum.\\nThe rollup transaction data is stored on Mantle DA. Verifiers can fetch this data at any point and verify its validity. This action is performed when issuing fraud proof challenges.\\nMantle DA nodes also post the validity certificates to L1 guaranteeing liveness and availability with each new batch.\\nIn case the state root validity is challenged with a fraud proof, L2 data is posted to the contract on L1 to perform the execution and check state transition validity.\\nFor more details on the role played by each network component, check out the Network Roles page.\\nRoadmap\\nThe following table tentatively summarizes our current approach to different network components and actions on L2 and L1 for our initial mainnet version, and other potential implementations that we're considering",
    " for future mainnet upgrades.\\nFailure Handling\\nL2 Sequencer Failure\\nIn the event of L2 Sequencing issues, common industry approaches to remain \\\"secured by Ethereum\\\" are:\\nEnqueue via L1**: Users can submit transactions to an L1 queue, but can't force them. The sequencer can selectively skip transactions, but cannot stop processing the queue entirely. In other words, if the sequencer censors or is down, it affects everyone.\\nForce via L1: Users can force sequencer to include a trade or a withdrawal transaction by submitting a request through L1. If the sequencer censors or is down for X period, users can use the exit hatch to withdraw their funds.\\nSelf Sequence: In the event of sequencer failure, users can force transactions to be included on L2 by sending them to L1.\\n** denotes approach of the initial Mantle Network Mainnet version\\nL2 Batch Submitter / Proposer Failure\\nThe Batch Submitter, or Proposer, is responsible for submitting the L2 state and necessary transaction data t",
    "o L1.

Let's go over the process of transaction handling to better understand how each module works.\\n\\n1.  Users send signed transactions via an available RPC node.\\n    \\n2.  The Sequencer receives transactions and pack them into blocks. The DTL (Data Transport Layer) service syncs this block data. Verifiers sync the L2 block data from the DTL.\\n    ",
    "\\n3.  The batch submitter fetches updated state roots and sends them to the Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) module to be verified and signed. Verifiers can also fetch the state root data and confirm their validity.\\n    \\n4.  Once TSS nodes establish the validity of the updated state roots and sign off on the rollup batches, the batch submitter publishes the state root data to the State Commitment Chain (SCC) contract on L1 Ethereum.\\n    \\n5.  The rollup transaction data is stored on Mantle DA. Verifiers can fetch this data at any point and verify its validity. This action is performed when issuing fraud proof challenges.\\n    \\n6.  Mantle DA nodes also post the validity certificates to L1 guaranteeing liveness and availability with each new batch.\\n    \\n7.  In case the state root validity is challenged with a fraud proof, L2 data is posted to the contract on L1 to perform the execution and check state transition validity.\\n    \\n\\nFor more details on the role played by each network",

    "cer can selectively skip transactions, but cannot stop processing the queue entirely.

If the sequencer censors or is down for X period, users can use the exit hatch to withdraw their funds.\\n    \\n*   **Self Sequence:** In the event of sequencer failure, users can force transactions to be included on L2 by sending them to L1.\\n    \\n\\n_\\\\*\\\\* denotes approach of the initial Mantle Network Mainnet version_\\n\\n### \\n\\n**L2 Batch Submitter / Proposer Failure**\\n\\nThe Batch Submitter, or Proposer, is responsible for submitting the L2 state and necessary transaction data to L1.

    "Q. Why does my transaction fail when I try to send a transaction with the \\\"Max\\\" amount from my wallet?\\nA transaction sent with the \\\"Max\\\" amount fails with an error stating that the transaction is underpriced because our gas oracle currently only supports fetching L2 gas fee estimation, which is why the wallet undercalculates the actual gas fee that needs to paid since it is not including the L1 rollup fee. This issue will be addressed with a future network update. In the meantime, we recommend leaving at least 0.5 $MNT in your wallet to pay for L1 rollup fees. \\nFor example, if you have 10 $MNT in your wallet, please limit the transaction amount to a maximum of 9.5 $MNT for a single transaction.\\nQ. Are there any limits set for batch transaction size?\\nThe maximum batch transaction size is derived from the target gas configuration. Mantle Network is the same as Ethereum in this regard.\\nQ. Are there any limits on the gas price that can be paid when sending transactions on Mantle N",
    "etwork?\\nCurrently, the gas range has been set to 0.05 - 200 Gwei in order to protect users from overpaying gas fees. This limit is active on Mantle Mainnet, and will soon be applied to testnet as well.\\nQ. Does Mantle Network support EIP-1559?\\nCurrently, Mantle Network does NOT support EIP-1559, so we recommend using legacy structuring for your transactions. The order of transactions is FIFO, and it will be executed based on the sequence (time of receiving) they are received in.\\nQ. Does Mantle Network support transactions that aren't signed with the chain ID?\\nNo, Mantle Network does not support pre-EIP155 transactions that aren't signed with the chain ID.\\nExplorer\\nQ.

Are there any limits on the gas price that can be paid when sending transactions on Mantle Network?\\n\\nCurrently, the gas range has been set to 0.05 - 200 Gwei in order to protect users from overpaying gas fees. This limit is active on Mantle Mainnet, and will soon be applied to testnet as well.\\n\\n### \\n\\nQ. Does Mantle Network support EIP-1559?\\n\\nCurrently, Mantle Network does **NOT** support EIP-1559, so we recommend using legacy structuring for your transactions. The order of transactions is FIFO, and it will be executed based on the sequence (time of receiving) they are received in.\\n\\n### \\n\\nQ. Does Mantle Network support transactions that aren't signed with the chain ID?\\n\\nNo, Mantle Network does not support pre-[EIP155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md) transactions that aren't signed with the chain ID.\\n\\n## \\n\\nExplorer\\n\\n### \\n\\nQ. Does the RPC rate limit affect Explorer API usage too?\\n\\nYes. Once",
    " the RPC rate limit is reached, access to Explorer API will also be limited.\\n\\n## \\n\\nNode operators\\n\\n### \\n\\nQ. How big is the current testnet state?\\n\\nYou can find details on this subject here:\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/how-to-guides/connecting-wallet-to-mantle-network\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/how-to-guides/connecting-wallet-to-mantle-network\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:32:55.379Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network?fallback=true\",\n    \"depth\": 2\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/how-to-guides/connecting-wallet-to-mantle-network\",\n    \"title\": \"Connecting Wallet to Mantle Network | Network\",\n    \"description\": \"Adding Mantle Network configuration and the $MNT token to your wallet\",\n    \"author\": null,\n    \"keywords\": null,\n    \"languag",

These signatures are verified by an EigenDA contract on Ethereum\\nMantle DA powered by EigenDA technology consists of a set of supported interactions between four major components as described below.\\nOperators\\nThe service providers of the DA network and need to confirm their commitment through digital signatures, which place staked assets as a collateral guarantee on their participation. An Operator carries out the following tasks:\\nRun nodes which store chunks of data for a pre-defined time period and serve these chunks upon request\\nDispersers\\nThey're the users of Mantle DA's data availability service, paying for its economic guarantees of data availability. This role may be played by a rollup Sequencer. A Disperser performs the following tasks:\\nEncodes its data into chunks, posts funds for making the data available for a fixed amount of time, and distributes the encoded chunks to Mantle DA operators\\nAggregates signat",

Challengers perform the following tasks:\\nMonitor certain verifiable operations of the protocol (which in the optimistic case are not verified or resolved on-chain) \\nPermissionlessly force problematic operations to be resolved on-chain, resulting in an operator’s stake being slashed\\nThe Proof of Custody protocol is in development stage and will go online with a future Mainnet upgrade.\\nMantleLayer and MantleDA Smart Contracts\\nThe collection of DA-related smart contracts running on Ethereum take care of the following:\\nEnsure that data is only accepted as available when a group of operators having a sufficient amount of stake has collectively signed\\nImplement the proof-of-custody protocol and provide mechanisms for a challenger to disclose",
    " data on chain\\nVerify the validity of data submitted by Challengers against a signed commitment, and enact slashing as dictated by the proof-of-custody protocol\\nThe data storage process on Mantle DA is as follows:\\nEncoding: Disperser encodes data chunks and generates KZG multireveal proofs which will allow Operators to verify the correctness of their chunk.\\nDispersal: Disperser sends data chunks to respective DA Operators\\nAttestation: Operators verify their chunks against the global commitment. If the verification is successful, the Operator proceeds to store their chunk of data for the duration specified by the Disperser and sends back an attestation\\nAggregation: If enough signatures are received, the Disperser aggregates the signatures and publishes them to L1 Ethereum.\\nWhy Run a Rollup Verifier Node?\\nThere are multiple advantages of running a Rollup Verifier node.\\nIt grants many of the benefits of running an Ethereum node, such as the ability to simulate L2 transactions loc",
    "ally without rate-limiting (public RPCs may face such limitations).\\nAllows anyone to verify the work performed by Sequencers by re-deriving output roots and comparing them against those submitted by the Sequencer. In case of a mismatch, verifiers will be able to perform a fault check and claim rewards by submitting fraud proofs on future versions of Mainnet.\\ndApp builders are encouraged to consider the value addition of running a Rollup Verifier node given that the overhead costs tend to be low.\\nThe diagram below illustrates how the Sequencer and Rollup Verifier fit together.

The state roots **MUST** be signed by a TSS node before they are sent to Ethereum to be recorded.\\n\\nDuring the initial phases of release, TSS nodes are run by a group of reputable institutions, but will eventually be voted in via Mantle governance permissionlessly.\\n\\n### \\n\\nRollup Verifiers / Replica Nodes\\n\\n*   Sync rollup data from Mantle's trusted sequencer\\n    \\n*   Verify the state roots submitted by Sequencers on L2\\n    \\n*   Initiate fraud proofs when invalid state data is found\\n    \\n*   Serve rollup data to users\\n    \\n\\nFraud proofs are a part of our [roadmap](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/introduction/architecture-and-roadmap#roadmap) and the feature will be added eventually via a Mainnet upgrade.\\n\\n### \\n\\nDA Nodes\\n\\n*   Opt into taking the responsibility of storing a copy of Mantle transaction data to have it ready for access whenever necessary\\n    \\n*   ",
    "Make a commitment by signing the block data they provide using the [BLS signature scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature) guaranteeing its usability. These signatures are verified by an EigenDA contract on Ethereum\\n    \\n\\nMantle DA powered by EigenDA technology consists of a set of supported interactions between four major components as described below.\\n\\n![](https://docs.mantle.xyz/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3701411312-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FNHXgeqhgrznnRobzznxl%252Fuploads%252FAsnGr1cXLy9Og1JIVxE8%252Fupdated%2520da%2520interaction.jpg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D1718a0e4-4941-4255-a886-c8c5af2fdfef&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=4935a0e1&sv=2)\\n\\n#### \\n\\nOperators\\n\\nThe service providers of the DA network and need to confirm their commitment through digital signatures, which place staked assets as a collateral guarantee on their participation. An Operator carries out the following tasks:\\n\\n",
    "*   Run nodes which store chunks of data for a pre-defined time period and serve these chunks upon request\\n    \\n\\n#### \\n\\nDispersers\\n\\nThey're the users of Mantle DA's data availability service, paying for its economic guarantees of data availability. This role may be played by a rollup [Sequencer](https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-validators/network-roles#sequencers). A Disperser performs the following tasks:\\n\\n*   Encodes its data into chunks, posts funds for making the data available for a fixed amount of time, and distributes the encoded chunks to Mantle DA operators\\n    \\n*   Aggregates signatures from the operators and posts an attestation to the blockchain, confirming availability of the data of interest for the specified time period\\n    \\n\\n#### \\n\\nChallengers\\n\\nThey're interested parties who play an important role in the Proof of Custody protocol. Challengers perform the following tasks:\\n\\n*   Monitor certain verifiable operations of the protocol (which in ",
    "the optimistic case are not verified or resolved on-chain)\\n    \\n*   Permissionlessly force problematic operations to be resolved on-chain, resulting in an operator’s stake being slashed\\n    \\n\\nThe Proof of Custody protocol is in development stage and will go online with a future Mainnet upgrade.\\n\\n#### \\n\\n`MantleLayer` and `MantleDA` Smart Contracts\\n\\nThe collection of DA-related smart contracts running on Ethereum take care of the following:\\n\\n*   Ensure that data is only accepted as available when a group of operators having a sufficient amount of stake has collectively signed\\n    \\n*   Implement the proof-of-custody protocol and provide mechanisms for a challenger to disclose data on chain\\n    \\n*   Verify the validity of data submitted by Challengers against a signed commitment, and enact slashing as dictated by the proof-of-custody protocol\\n    \\n\\nThe data storage process on Mantle DA is as follows:\\n\\n1.  Encoding: Disperser encodes data chunks and generates KZG multi",
    "reveal proofs which will allow Operators to verify the correctness of their chunk.\\n    \\n2.  Dispersal: Disperser sends data chunks to respective DA Operators\\n    \\n3.  Attestation: Operators verify their chunks against the global commitment. If the verification is successful, the Operator proceeds to store their chunk of data for the duration specified by the Disperser and sends back an attestation\\n    \\n4.  Aggregation: If enough signatures are received, the Disperser aggregates the signatures and publishes them to L1 Ethereum.\\n    \\n\\n## \\n\\n**Why Run a Rollup Verifier Node?**\\n\\nThere are multiple advantages of running a Rollup Verifier node.\\n\\n1.  It grants many of the benefits of running an Ethereum node, such as the ability to simulate L2 transactions locally **without rate-limiting** (public RPCs may face such limitations)**.**\\n    \\n2.  Allows anyone to verify the work performed by Sequencers by **re-deriving output roots** and **comparing** them against those submitted ",
    "by the Sequencer. In case of a mismatch, verifiers will be able to perform a fault check and claim rewards by submitting fraud proofs on future versions of Mainnet.\\n    \\n\\n**dApp builders** are encouraged to consider the value addition of running a Rollup Verifier node given that the overhead costs tend to be low.\\n\\nThe diagram below illustrates how the Sequencer and Rollup Verifier fit together. Note that actions in red are performed by a **Sequencer**, while actions in blue are performed by a **Rollup Verifier**:\\n\\nLast updated 11 months ago\",\n  \"debug\": {\n    \"requestHandlerMode\": \"http\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/resources-and-tooling/covalent-data-indexing-api\",\n  \"crawl\": {\n    \"loadedUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network/for-devs/resources-and-tooling/covalent-data-indexing-api\",\n    \"loadedTime\": \"2025-02-15T20:32:57.863Z\",\n    \"referrerUrl\": \"https://docs.mantle.xyz/network/network?fallback=true\",\n    \"depth\": 2\n  },\n  \"met",

It can manage dependencies, compile your project, run tests, deploy contracts, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line and via Solidity scripts.Foundry comes with the following tools that can be used to debugging:\\nAnvil: Used to deploy a local Ethereum node\\nCast: Used ",
    "to send RPC calls and interact with the chain\\nForge: Used to build, compile, and test smart contracts\\nYou can install Foundry by running the following commands:\\nLinux/Mac:\\ncurl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash foundryup\\nWindows: (Requires Rust, install from https://rustup.rs/)\\ncargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry --bins --locked\\nDocker:\\ndocker pull ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest\\nAnvil\\nAnvil deploys a local Ethereum node in your environment that can be used to deploy a node. Simply run anvil to deploy one. \\nIt has a few useful properties. It allows you to fork a network at the latest, or any specific height. You can run the following command to fork the Mantle mainnet environment for debugging your code:\\nexport RPC_URL=\\\"https://rpc.mantle.xyz\\\" anvil --fork-url $RPC_URL\\nCall traces are more detailed, i.e., we can see which functions are being executed in remote contracts, i.e., the functions that executed by every contract.\\nNote that it isn't",
    " necessary to use an Anvil node to use Foundry. You can use other local nodes like Hardhat, Ganache, etc. as well.\\nCast\\nYou can use the following cast commands to interact with the chain.\\nThe examples below are based on Anvil. If you have Anvil up and running, try invoking the following cases in another command line window. This will allow you to debug online contracts using the mantle mainnet.\\ncast call / cast send\\ncast send can be used to sign and publish a transaction on the chain.You can use it make an arbitrary contract method call, like so:\\ncast send $contract_address \\\"someFunc(unit256)\\\" 0x... \\\\--private-key $wallet_private_key\\ncast call on the other hand can be used to perform an account call without publishing it to the chain, and that's why you don't need to specify a private key.So for instance, you can make a contract method call, like so:\\ncast call $contract_address \\\"someFunc(uint, args[])\\\" $number \\\"[arg_1, ... , arg_n]\\\"\\nexport WMNT=0x78c1b0C915c4FAA5FffA6CA",

For example:\\ncast run $TX_HASH\\ncast run 0xf500a3c8e08960aa28ccdd557730087b1d9b618a42b9595c7800ceeff53dddaa\\nYou can also replay transactions in the debugger using the --debug flag, like so:\\ncast run --debug $TX_HASH\\nTaking this deposit transaction as an example:\\ncast run 0x16a3d14f54fc36097184b2b774b0d30e35e03e033805eb3180a0ee8d4c5427ef --debug\\nLearn more about the debugger interface here: https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/debugger\\ncast block / cast tx\\ncast block can be used to fetch block information from the chain. Running cast block returns block info for the latest block.\\ncast tx can be used to f",
    "etch transaction information from the chain using the transaction hash. The command structure is as follows:\\ncast tx $TX_HASH\\ncast rpc\\ncast rpc can be used to send a raw JSON-RPC request to a node.Since Mantle Network supports Ethereum's JSON-RPC interface, you can use the following command to call eth_getBlockByNumber and fetch information for the latest block:\\ncast rpc --rpc-url https://rpc.mantle.xyz/ eth_getBlockByNumber \\\"latest\\\" \\\"false\\\"\\ncast storage & cast index\\ncast storage can be used to fetch the raw value of a contract's storage slot. cast-index can compute the storage slot location for an entry in a mapping.The cast index calculates the storage location based on the KEY_TYPE, KEY, and SLOT_NUMBER.For example, to fetch the value of slot 0 for a contract:\\ncast storage $contract_address 0\\nWe'll take the balance of account 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f about $WMNT as an example, which can be obtained in two ways:\\nConventional function call method This ha",
    "s already been implemented in the aforementioned cast call.\\nReading contract slot storage method First, based on the WMNT source code, it's determined that the balanceOf state variable is located at the 0th slot with KEY_TYPE being 'address'.\\ncontract WMANTLE is ERC20 { constructor() ERC20(\\\"Wrapped Mantle\\\", \\\"WMNT\\\") {} event Deposit(address indexed dst, uint256 wad); event Withdrawal(address indexed src, uint256 wad); ... contract ERC20 is Context, IERC20, IERC20Metadata { mapping(address => uint256) private _balances; mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) private _allowances; uint256 private _totalSupply; string private _name; string private _symbol; ...\\n＃ For KEY 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f and slot 0, the corresponding storage location. cast index address 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f 0 //0x2edcadc9f197c279f92ccdbf8b108a59937d545e881935fccd2cb58923bc739b ＃ Retrieve the raw data from the corresponding storage location, converting from addre",

For example, to decode the output data for a balanceOf call:\\ncast abi-decode \\\"balanceOf(address)(uint256)\\\" \\\\0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a\\ncast abi-encode can be used to ABI encode any given function arguments, excluding the selector.

    "manage dependencies, compile your project, run tests, deploy contracts, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line and via Solidity scripts.Foundry comes with the following tools that can be used to debugging:\\n\\n*   Anvil: Used to deploy a local Ethereum node\\n    \\n*   Cast: Used to send RPC calls and interact with the chain\\n    \\n*   Forge: Used to build, compile, and test smart contracts\\n    \\n\\nYou can install Foundry by running the following commands:\\n\\n**Linux/Mac**:\\n\\n```\\ncurl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash\\nfoundryup\\n```\\n\\n**Windows**: (Requires Rust, install from [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/))\\n\\n```\\ncargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry --bins --locked\\n```\\n\\n**Docker**:\\n\\n```\\ndocker pull ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest\\n```\\n\\n#### \\n\\nAnvil\\n\\nAnvil deploys a local Ethereum node in your environment that can be used to deploy a node. Simply run anvil to deploy one.\\n\\nIt has a few useful properties. It allo",
    "ws you to fork a network at the latest, or any specific height. You can run the following command to fork the Mantle mainnet environment for debugging your code:\\n\\n```\\nexport RPC_URL=\\\"https://rpc.mantle.xyz\\\"\\nanvil --fork-url $RPC_URL\\n```\\n\\nCall traces are more detailed, i.e., we can see which functions are being executed in remote contracts, i.e., the functions that executed by every contract.\\n\\nNote that it isn't necessary to use an Anvil node to use Foundry. You can use other local nodes like Hardhat, Ganache, etc. as well.\\n\\n#### \\n\\nCast\\n\\nYou can use the following cast commands to interact with the chain.\\n\\nThe examples below are based on Anvil. If you have Anvil up and running, try invoking the following cases in another command line window. This will allow you to debug online contracts using the mantle mainnet.\\n\\n**cast call / cast send**\\n\\n[cast send](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-send) can be used to sign and publish a transaction on the chain.You",
    " can use it make an arbitrary contract method call, like so:\\n\\n> cast send $contract\\\\_address \\\"someFunc(unit256)\\\" 0x... \\\\\\\\--private-key $wallet\\\\_private\\\\_key\\n\\n[cast call](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-call) on the other hand can be used to perform an account call without publishing it to the chain, and that's why you don't need to specify a private key.So for instance, you can make a contract method call, like so:\\n\\n> cast call $contract\\\\_address \\\"someFunc(uint, args\\\\[\\\\])\\\" $number \\\"\\\\[arg\\\\_1, ... , arg\\\\_n\\\\]\\\"\\n\\n```\\nexport WMNT=0x78c1b0C915c4FAA5FffA6CAbf0219DA63d7f4cb8\\ncast call $WMNT \\\"balanceOf(address)\\\" 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f\\n//0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000006cfd1854e3ec57a5d636d\\ncast --to-dec 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000006cfd1854e3ec57a5d636d\\n//8234949754837270014026605\\n```\\n\\n**cast run**\\n\\n[cast run](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-run) can be used to run a published tra",

Running `cast block` returns block info for the latest block.\\n\\n[`cast tx`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-tx) can be used to fetch transaction information from the chain using the transaction hash. The command structure is as follows:\\n\\n> cast",
    " tx $TX\\\\_HASH\\n\\n**cast rpc**\\n\\n[`cast rpc`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-rpc) can be used to send a raw JSON-RPC request to a node.Since Mantle Network supports Ethereum's JSON-RPC interface, you can use the following command to call `eth_getBlockByNumber` and fetch information for the latest block:\\n\\n> cast rpc --rpc-url https://rpc.mantle.xyz/ eth\\\\_getBlockByNumber \\\"latest\\\" \\\"false\\\"\\n\\n#### \\n\\ncast storage & cast index\\n\\n[`cast storage`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-storage) can be used to fetch the raw value of a contract's storage slot. cast-index can compute the storage slot location for an entry in a mapping.The cast index calculates the storage location based on the KEY\\\\_TYPE, KEY, and SLOT\\\\_NUMBER.For example, to fetch the value of slot 0 for a contract:\\n\\n> cast storage $contract\\\\_address 0\\n\\nWe'll take the balance of account 0x1858d52cf57c07A018171D7a1E68DC081F17144f about $WMNT as an example, which can be obtained in two way",

The $BIT contract remains unchanged.\\nHere’s a list of contract addresses on Goerli that we’ll interact with in this guide:\\nIn this short guide, we’ll go over how to migrate your test $BIT to $MNT on Goerli. This is to enable access to $MNT for developers and teams with existing dApps on Goerli testnet that utilize $BIT.\\nWe recommend users without developer experience to wait for the official migration tool to go live and use that to migrate tokens instead!\\nStep 1: Install Foundry and Cast\\nThe first step would be to install Foundry, since we’re going to be using a command line tool, which is part of the foundry developer toolkit, called cast to initiate $",
    "BIT approval transactions.\\nTo confirm cast is correctly installed, run this command:\\nIf cast was installed correctly, it will print out the current version, like this:\\ncast 0.2.0 (6cd6618 2022-08-11T00:05:44.416299Z)\\nStep 2: Get an API Key\\nOnce we've installed Foundry, we need to obtain an API key for a Goerli RPC node provider. For this guide, we'll use Infura.\\nCreate an API Key by clicking the “Create new API Key” button, then select “Web3 API” from the Network dropdown menu.\\nAfter entering the name of your key, move to the “Endpoints” tab where you’ll see your API Key!\\nCopy and save it somewhere! You'll need it for the next step.\\nStep 3: Approve $BIT Spending for Migration Contract\\nNow, use the following command to send a transaction to approve $BIT spending for the migration contract. You'll need to replace the arguments with your wallet address containing the $BIT tokens, private key, the amount of $BIT you want to approve, and your API key.\\nNote that the amount of $BIT",
    " needs to be specified in wei, which means 1 $BIT will need to be specified as 10^18, or 1 followed by 18 zeroes. You can use this tool for an accurate conversion. \\nThe amount you pass here is important because this is the maximum amount of $BIT the migration contract will be able to migrate. \\nMake sure your wallet has sufficient $gETH to send this transaction\\ncast send --from \\\"your address\\\" --private-key \\\"your private key\\\" 0x5a94dc6cc85fda49d8e9a8b85dde8629025c42be \\\"approve(address,uint256)\\\" 0x144D9B7F34a4e3133C6F347886fBe2700c4cb268 “amount” --rpc-url https://goerli.infura.io/v3/\\\"your api key\\\"\\nUpon running the command, you'll see a response like the following:\\nStep 4: Migrate $BIT to $MNT\\nWe can call the migration contract from Etherscan.\\nFollow the link below to navigate to the migration contract on Etherscan.\\nConnect your wallet to the webpage.\\nYou can now use the migrateAllBIT function is you've approved all the available $BIT in your wallet. To specify an amount,",

The $BIT contract remains unchanged.\\n\\nHere’s a list of contract addresses on Goerli that we’ll interact with in this guide:\\n\\n",
    "In this short guide, we’ll go over how to migrate your test $BIT to $MNT on Goerli. This is to enable access to $MNT for developers and teams with existing dApps on Goerli testnet that utilize $BIT.\\n\\nWe recommend users without developer experience to wait for the official migration tool to go live and use that to migrate tokens instead!\\n\\n## \\n\\nStep 1: Install Foundry and Cast\\n\\nThe first step would be to install Foundry, since we’re going to be using a command line tool, which is part of the foundry developer toolkit, called `cast` to initiate $BIT approval transactions.\\n\\n2.  To confirm `cast` is correctly installed, run this command:\\n    \\n\\nIf cast was installed correctly, it will print out the current version, like this:\\n\\n```\\ncast 0.2.0 (6cd6618 2022-08-11T00:05:44.416299Z)\\n```\\n\\n## \\n\\nStep 2: Get an API Key\\n\\nOnce we've installed Foundry, we need to obtain an API key for a Goerli RPC node provider.
